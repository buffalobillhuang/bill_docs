<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <BR>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The apartment where O lived was situated on the Ile
Saint-Louis, under the eaves of an old house which faced south and overlooked
the Seine. All the rooms, which were spacious and low, had sloping ceilings,
and the two rooms at the front of the house each opened onto a balcony set into
the sloping roof. One of them was O's room; the other, in which bookshelves
filled one wall from floor to ceiling on either side of the fireplace, served
as a living room, a study, and even as a bedroom in case of necessity. Facing
the two windows was a big couch, and there was a large antique table before the
fireplace. It was here that they dined whenever the tiny dining room, which
faced the interior courtyard and was decorated with dark green serge, was
really too small to accommodate the guests. Another room, which also looked
onto the courtyard, was Ren&eacute;'s, and it was here that he dressed and kept
his clothes. O shared the yellow bathroom with him; the kitchen, also yellow,
was tiny. A cleaning woman came in every day. The flooring of the rooms
overlooking the courtyard was of red tile, those antique hexagonal tiles which
in old Paris hotels are used to cover the stairs and landings above the second
story. Seeing them again gave O a shock and made her heart beat faster: they
were the same tiles as the ones in the hallways at Roissy. Her room was small,
the pink and black chintz curtains were closed, the fire was glowing behind the
metallic screen, the bed was made, the covers turned back. </FONT></P>
<P>&quot;I bought you a nylon nightgown,&quot; Ren&eacute; said. &quot;You've
never had one before.&quot; </P>
<P>Yes, a white pleated nylon nightgown, tailored and tasteful like the
clothing of Egyptian statuettes, an almost transparent nightgown was unfolded
on the edge of the bed, on the side where O slept. O tied a thin belt around
her waist, over the elastic waistband of the nightgown itself, and the material
of the gown was so light that the projection of the buttocks colored it a pale
pink. Everything - save for the curtains and the panel hung with the same
material against which the head of the bed was set, and the two small armchairs
upholstered with the same chintz - everything in the room was white: the walls,
the fringe around the mahogany four-poster bed, and the bearskin rug on the
floor. Seated before the fire in her white nightgown, O listened to her lover. 
</P>
<P>He began by saying that she should not think that she was now free. With one
exception, and that was that she was free not to love him any longer, and to
leave him immediately. But if she did love him, then she was in no wise free.
She listened to him without saying a word, thinking how happy she was that he
wanted to prove to himself - it mattered little how - that she belonged to him,
and thinking too that he was more than a little naive not to realize that this
proprietorship was beyond any proof. But did he perhaps realize it and want to
emphasize it merely because he derived a certain pleasure from it? She gazed
into the fire as he talked, but he did not, not daring to meet her eyes. He was
standing, pacing back and forth. Suddenly he said to her that, for a start, he
wanted her to listen to him with her knees unclasped and her arms unfolded, for
she was sitting with her knees together and her arms folded around them. So she
lifted her nightgown and, on her knees, or, rather, squatting on her heels in
the manner of the Carmelites or the Japanese women, she waited. The only thing
was, since her knees were spread, she could feel the light, sharp pricking of
the white fur between her half-open thighs; he came back to it again: she was
not opening her legs wide enough. The word &quot;open&quot; and the expression
&quot;opening her legs&quot; were, on her lover's lips, charged with such
uneasiness and power that she could never hear them without experiencing a kind
of internal prostration, a sacred submission, as though a god, and not he, had
spoken to her. So she remained motionless, and her hands were lying palm upward
beside her knees, between which the material of her nightgown was spread, with
the pleats reforming. </P>
<P>What her lover wanted from her was very simple: that she be constantly and
immediately accessible. It was not enough for him to know that she was: she was
to be so without the slightest obstacle intervening, and her bearing and
clothing were to bespeak, as it were, the symbol of that availability to
experienced eyes. That, he went on, meant two things. The first she knew,
having been informed of it the evening of her arrival at the ch&acirc;teau:
that she must never cross her knees, as her lips had always to remain open. She
doubtless thought that this was nothing (that was indeed what she did think),
but she would learn that to maintain this discipline would require a constant
effort on her part, an effort which would remind her, in the secret they shared
between them and perhaps with a few others, of the reality of her condition,
when she was with those who did not share the secret, and engaged in ordinary
pursuits. </P>
<P>As for her clothes, it was up to her to choose them, or if need be to invent
them, so that this semi-undressing to which he had subjected her in the car on
their way to Roissy would no longer be necessary: tomorrow she was to go
through her closet and sort out her dresses, and do the same with her
underclothing by going through her dresser drawers. She would hand over to him
absolutely everything she found in the way of belts and panties; the same for
any brassieres like the one whose straps he had had to cut before he could
remove it, any full slips which covered her breasts, all the blouses and
dresses which did not open up the front, and any skirts too tight to be raised
with a single movement. She was to have other brassieres, other blouses, other
dresses made. Meanwhile, was she supposed to visit her corset maker with
nothing on under her blouse or sweater? Yes, she was to go with nothing on
underneath. If someone should notice, she could explain it any way she liked,
or not explain it at all, whichever she preferred, but it was her problem and
hers alone. Now, as for the rest of what he still had to teach her, he
preferred to wait for a few days and wanted her to be dressed properly before
hearing it. She would find all the money she needed in the little drawer of her
desk. When he had finished speaking, she murmured &quot;I love you&quot;
without the slightest gesture. It was he who added some wood to the fire,
lighted the bedside lamp, which was of pink opaline. Then he told O to get into
bed and wait for him, that he would sleep with her. When he came back, O
reached over to turn out the lamp: it was her left hand, and the last thing she
saw before the room was plunged into darkness was the somber glitter of her
iron ring. She was lying half on her side: her lover called her softly by name
and, simultaneously, seizing her with his whole hand, covered the nether part
of her belly and drew her to him. </P>
<P>&nbsp; </P>
<P> </P>

</bLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="images/crop2.gif"> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <P>&nbsp; </P>
<P>The next day, O, in her dressing gown, had just finished lunch alone in the
green dining room - Ren&eacute; had left early in the morning and was not due
home until evening, to take her out to dinner - when the phone rang. The phone
was in the bedroom, beneath the lamp at the head of the bed. O sat down on the
floor to answer it. It was Ren&eacute; who wanted to know whether the cleaning
woman had left. Yes, she had just left, after having served lunch, and would
not be back till the following morning. </P>
<P>&quot;Have you started to sort out your clothes yet?&quot; Ren&eacute; said.
</P>
<P>&quot;I was just going to start,&quot; she answered, &quot;but I got up
late, took a batch, and it was noon before I was ready.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Are you dressed?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;No, I have on my nightgown and my dressing gown.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Put the phone down, take off your robe and your nightgown.&quot; </P>
<P>O obeyed, so startled that the phone slipped from the bed where she had
placed it down onto the white rug, and she thought she had been cut off. No,
she had not been cut off. </P>
<P>&quot;Are you naked?&quot; Ren&eacute; went on. </P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said. &quot;But where are you calling from?&quot; </P>
<P>He ignored her question, merely adding: </P>
<P>&quot;Did you keep your ring on?&quot; </P>
<P>She had her ring on. </P>
<P>Then he told her to remain as she was until he came home and to prepare,
thus undressed, the suitcase of clothing she was to get rid of. Then he hung
up. </P>
<P>It was past one o'clock, and the weather was lovely. A small pool of
sunlight fell on the rug, lighting the white nightgown and the corduroy
dressing gown, pale green like the shells of fresh almonds, which O had let
slip to the floor when she had taken them off. She picked them up and went to
take them into the bathroom, to hang them up in a closet. On her way, she
suddenly saw her reflection in one of the mirrors fastened to a door and which,
together with another mirror covering part of the wall and a third on another
door, formed a large three-faced mirror: all she was wearing was a pair of
leather mules the same green as her dressing gown - and only slightly darker
than the mules she wore at Roissy - and her ring. She was no longer wearing
either a collar or leather bracelets, and she was alone, her own sole
spectator. And yet never had she felt more totally committed to a will which
was not her own, more totally a slave, and more content to be so. </P>
<P>When she bent down to open a drawer, she saw her breasts stir gently. It
took her almost two hours to lay out on her bed the clothes which she then had
to pack away in the suitcase. There was no problem about the panties; she made
a little pile of them near one of the bedposts. The same for her brassieres,
not one would stay, for they all had a strap in the back and fastened on the
side. And yet she saw how she could have the same model made, by shifting the
catch to the front, in the middle, directly beneath the cleavage of the
breasts. The girdles and garter belts posed no further problems, but she
hesitated to add to the pile the corset of pink satin brocade which laced up in
the back and so closely resembled the bodice she had worn at Roissy. She put it
aside on the drawer. That would be Ren&eacute;'s decision. He would also decide
about the sweaters, all of which went on over the head and were tight at the
neck, therefore could not be opened. But they could be pulled up from the waist
and thus bare the breasts. All the slips, however, were piled on her bed. In
the dresser drawer there still remained a flounce and fine Valenciennes lace,
which was made to be worn under a pleated sun skirt of black wool which was too
sheer not to be transparent. She would need other half-length slips, short,
light-colored ones. She also realized that she would either have to give up
wearing sheath dresses or else pick out the kin of dress that buttoned all the
way down the front, in which case she would also have to have her slips made in
such a way that they would open together with the dress. As for the petticoats,
that was easy, the dresses too, but what would her dressmaker say about the
underclothes? She would explain that she wanted a detachable lining, because
she was cold-blooded. As a matter of fact, she was sensitive to the cold, and
suddenly she wondered how in the world she would stand the winter cold when she
was dressed so lightly? </P>
<P>When she had finally finished, and had kept from her entire wardrobe only
her blouses, all of which buttoned down the front, her black pleated skirt, her
coats of course, and the suit she had worn home from Roissy, she went to
prepare tea. She turned up the thermostat in the kitchen; the cleaning woman
had not filled the wood basket for the living-room fire, and O knew that her
lover liked to find her in the living room beside the fire when he arrived home
in the evening. She filled the basket from the woodpile in the hallway closet,
carried it back to the living-room fireplace, and lighted the fire. Thus she
waited for him, curled up in a big easy chair, the tea tray beside her, waited
for him to come home, but this time she waited, the way he had ordered her to,
naked. </P>
<P>The first difficulty O encountered was in her work. Difficulty is perhaps an
exaggeration. Astonishment would be a better term. O worked in the fashion
department of a photography agency. This meant that it was she who
photographed, in the studios where they had to pose for hours on end, the most
exotic and prettiest girls whom the fashion designers had chosen to model their
creations. </P>
<P>They were surprised that O had postponed her vacation until this late in the
fall and had thus been away at a time of year when the fashion world was
busiest, when the new collections were about to be presented. But that was
nothing. What surprised them most was how changed she was. At first glance,
they found it hard to say exactly what was changed about her, but none the less
they felt it, and the more they observed her, the more convinced they were. She
stood and walked straighter, her eyes were clearer, but what ws especially
striking was her perfection when she was in repose, and how measured her
gestures were. </P>
<P>She had always been a conservative dresser, the way girls do whose work
resembles that of men, but she was so skillful that she brought it off; and
because the other girls - who constituted her subjects - were constantly
concerned, both professionally and personally, with clothing and adornments,
they were quick to note what might have passed unperceived to eyes other than
theirs. Sweaters worn right next to the skin, which gently molded the contours
of the breasts - Ren&eacute; had finally consented to the sweaters - pleated
skirts so prone to swirling when she turned: O wore them so often it was a
little as though they formed a discreet uniform. </P>
<P>&quot;Very little-girl like,&quot; one of the models said to her one day, a
blond, green-eyed model with high Slavic cheekbones and the olive complexion
that goes with it. &quot;But you shouldn't wear garters,&quot; she added.
&quot;You're going to ruin your legs.&quot; </P>
<P>This remark was occasioned by O, who, without stopping to think, had sat
down somewhat hastily in her presence, and obliquely in front of her, on the
arm of a big leather easy chair, and in so doing had lifted her skirt. The tall
girl had glimpsed a flash of naked thigh above the rolled stocking, which
covered the knee but stopped just above it. </P>
<P>O had seen her smile, so strangely that she wondered what the girl had been
thinking at the time, or perhaps what she had understood. She adjusted her
stockings, one at a time, pulling them up to tighten them, for it was not as
easy to keep them tight this way as it was when the stockings ended at
mid-thigh and were fastened to a garter belt, and answered Jacqueline, as
though to justify herself: </P>
<P>&quot;It's practical.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Practical for what?&quot; Jacqueline wanted to know. </P>
<P>&quot;I dislike garter belts,&quot; O replied. </P>
<P>But Jacqueline was not listening to her and was looking at the iron ring. 
</P>
<P>During the next few days, O took some fifty photographs of Jacqueline. They
were like nothing she had ever taken before. Never, perhaps, had she had such a
model. Anyway, never before had she been able to extract such meaning and
emotion from a face or body. And yet all she was aiming for was to make the
silks, the furs, and the laces more beautiful by that sudden beauty of an elfin
creature surprised by her reflection in the mirror, which Jacqueline became in
the simplest blouse, as she did in the most elegant mink. She had short, thick,
blond hair, only slightly curly, and at the least excuse she would cock her
head slightly toward her left shoulder and nestle her cheek against the
upturned collar of her fur, if she were wearing fur. O caught her once in this
position, tender and smiling, her hair gently blown as though by a soft wind,
and her smooth, hard cheekbone snuggled against the gray mink, soft and gray as
the freshly fallen ashes of a wood fire. Her lips were slightly parted, and her
eyes half-closed. Beneath the gleaming, liquid gloss of the photograph she
looked like some blissful girl who had drowned, she was pale, so pale. O had
the picture printed with as little contrast as possible. She had taken another
picture of Jacqueline with she found even more stunning: back lighted, it
portrayed her bare-shouldered, with her delicate head, and her face as well,
enveloped in a large-meshed black veil surmounted by an absurd double aigrette
whose impalpable tufts crowned her like wisps of smoke; she was wearing an
enormous robe of heavy brocaded silk, red like the dress of a bride in the
Middle Ages, which came down to below her ankles, flared at the hips and tight
at the waist, and the armature of which traced the outline of her bosom. It was
what the dress designers called a gala gown, the kind no one ever wears. The
spike-heeled sandals were also of red silk. And all the time Jacqueline was
before O dressed in that gown and sandals, and that veil which was like the
premonition of a mask, O, in her mind's eye, was completing, was inwardly
modifying the model: a trifle here, a trifle there - the waist drawn in a
little tighter, the breasts slightly raised - and it was the same dress as at
Roissy, the same dress that Jeanne had worn, the same smooth, heavy, cascading
silk which one takes by the handful and raises whenever one is told to ... Why
yes, Jacqueline was lifting it in just that way as she descended from the
platform on which she had been posting for the past fifteen minutes. It was the
same rustling, the same crackling of dried leaves. No one wears these gala
gowns any longer? But they do. Jacqueline was also wearing a gold choker around
her neck, and on her wrists two gold bracelets. O caught herself thinking that
she would be more beautiful with leather collar and leather bracelets. And then
she did something she had never done before: she followed Jacqueline into the
large dressing room adjacent to the studio, where the models dressed and made
up and where they left their clothing and make-up kits after hours. She
remained standing, leaning against the doorjamb, her eyes glued to the mirror
of the dressing table before which Jacqueline, without removing her gown, had
sat down. The mirror was so big - it covered the entire back wall, and the
dressing table itself was a simple slab of black glass - that she could see
Jacqueline's and her own reflection, as doing the aigrettes and the tulle
netting. Jacqueline removed the choker herself, her bare arms lifted like two
handles; a touch of perspiration gleamed in her armpits, which were shaved
(Why? O wondered, what a pity, she's so fair), and O could smell the sharp
delicate, slightly plantlike odor and wondered what perfume Jacqueline ought to
wear - what perfume they would make her wear. Then Jacqueline unclasped her
bracelets and put them on the glass slab, where they made a momentary clanking
sound like the sound of chains. Her hair was so fair that her skin was actually
darker than her hair, a grayish beige like fine-grained sand just after the
tide has gone out. On the photograph, the red silk would be black. Just then,
the thick eyelashes, which Jacqueline was always reluctant to make up, lifted,
and in the mirror O met her gaze, a look so direct and steady that, without
being able to detach her own eyes from it, she felt herself slowly blushing.
That was all. </P>
<P>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Jacqueline said, &quot;I have to undress.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Sorry,&quot; O murmured, and closed the door. </P>
<P>The next day she took home with her the proofs of the shots she had made the
day before, not really knowing whether she wanted, or did not want, to show
them to her love, with whom she had a dinner date. She looked at them as she
was putting on her make-up at the dressing table in her room, pausing to trace
on the photographs with her finger the curve of an eyebrow, the suggestion of a
smile. But when she heard the sound of the key in the front door, she slipped
them into the drawer. </P>

<IMG SRC="images/crop2.gif"> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <P>&nbsp; </P>
<P>For two weeks, O had been completely outfitted and ready for use, and could
not get used to being so, when she discovered one evening upon returning from
the studio a note from her lover asking her to be ready at eight to join him
and one of his friends for dinner. A car would stop by to pick her up, the
chauffeur would come up and ring her bell. The postscript specified that she
was to take her fur jacket, that she was to dress entirely in black
(<I>entirely</I> was underlined), and was to be at pains to make up and perfume
herself as at Roissy. </P>
<P>It was six o'clock. Entirely in black, and for dinner - and it was
mid-December, the weather was cold, that meant black silk stockings, black
gloves, her pleated fan-shaped skirt, a heavy-knit sweater, with spangles or
her short jacket of faille. It was padded and quilted in large stitches, close
fitting and hooked from neck to waist like the tight-fitting doublets that men
used to wear in the sixteenth century, and if it molded the bosom so perfectly,
it was because the brassiere was built into it. It was lined of the same
faille, and its slit tails were hip-length. The only bright foil were the large
gold hooks like those on children's snow boots which made a clicking sound as
they were hooked or unhooked from their broad flat rings. </P>
<P>After she had laid out her clothes on her bed, and at the foot of the bed
her black suede shoes with raised soles and spiked heels, nothing seemed
stranger to O than to see herself, solitary and free in her bathroom,
meticulously making herself up and perfuming herself, after she had taken her
bath, as she had done at Roissy. The cosmetics she owned were not the same as
those used at Roissy. In the drawer of her dressing table she found some face
rouge - she never used any - which she utilized to emphasize the halo of her
breasts. It was a rouge which was scarcely visible when first applied, but when
darkened later. At first she thought she had put on too much and tried to take
a little off with alcohol - it was very hard to remove - and started all over:
a dark peony pink flowered at the tip of her breasts. Vainly she tried to make
up the lips which the fleece of her loins concealed, but the rouge left no
mark. Finally, among the tubes of lipstick she had in the same drawer, she
found one of those kiss proof lipsticks which she did not like to use because
they were too dry and too hard to remove. There, it worked. She fixed her hair
and freshened her face, then finally put on the perfume. Ren&eacute; had given
her, in an atomizer which released a heavy spray, a perfume whose name she
didn't know, which had the odor of dry wood and marshy plants, a pungent,
slightly savage odor. On her skin the spray melted, on the fur of the armpits
and belly it ran and formed tiny droplets. </P>
<P>At Roissy, O had learned to take her time: she perfumed herself three times,
each time allowing the perfume to dry. First she put on her stockings, and high
heels, then the petticoat and skirt, then the jacket. She put on her gloves and
took her bag. In her bag were her compact, her lipstick, a comb, her key, and
ten francs. Wearing her gloves, she took her fur coat from the closet and
glanced at the time at the head of her bed: quarter to eight. She sat down
diagonally on the edge of the bed and, her eyes riveted to the alarm clock,
waited without moving for the bell to ring. When she heard it at last and rose
to leave, she noticed in the mirror above her dressing table, before turning
out the light, her bold, gentle, docile expression. </P>
<P>When she pushed open the door of the little Italian restaurant before which
the car had stopped, the first person she saw, at the bar, was Ren&eacute;. He
smiled at her tenderly, took her by the hand, and turning toward a sort of
grizzled athlete, introduced her tin English to Sir Stephen H. O was offered a
stool between the two men, and as she was about to sit down Ren&eacute; said to
her in a half-whisper to be careful not to muss her dress. He helped her to
slide her skirt out from under her and down over the edges of the stool, the
cold leather of which she felt against her skin, while the metal rim around it
pressed directly against the furrow of her thighs, for at first she had dared
only half sit down, for fear that if she were to sit down completely she might
yield to the temptation to cross her legs. Her skirt billowed around her. Her
right heel was caught in one of the rungs of the stool, the tip of her left
foot was touching the floor. The Englishman, who had bowed without uttering a
word, had not taken his eyes off her, she saw that he was looking at her knees,
her hands, and finally at her lips - but so calmly and with such precise
attention, with such self-assurance, that O felt herself being weighed and
measured as the instrument she knew full well she was, and it was as though
compelled by his gaze and, so to speak, in spite of herself that she withdrew
her gloves: she knew that he would speak when her hands were bare - because she
had unusual hands, more like those of a young boy than the hands of a woman,
and because she was wearing on the third finger of her left hand the iron ring
with the triple spiral of gold. But no, he said nothing, he smiled: he had seen
the ring. </P>
<P>Ren&eacute; was drinking a martini, Sir Stephen a whisky. He nursed his
whisky, then waited till Ren&eacute; had drunk his second martini and O the
grapefruit juice that Ren&eacute; had ordered for her, meanwhile explaining
that if O would be good enough to concur in their joint opinion, they would
dine in the room downstairs, which was smaller and less noisy than the one on
the first floor, which was simply the extension of the bar. </P>
<P>&quot;Of course,&quot; O said, already gathering up her bag and gloves which
she had placed on the bar. </P>
<P>Then, to help her off the stool, Sir Stephen offered her his right hand, in
which she placed hers, he finally addressing her directly by observing that she
had hands that were made to wear irons, so becoming was iron to her. But as he
said it in English, there was a trace of ambiguity in his words, leaving one in
some doubt as to whether he was referring to the metal alone or whether he were
not also, and perhaps even specifically, referring to iron chains. </P>
<P>In the room downstairs, which was a simple white-washed cellar, but cool and
pleasant, there were in fact only four tables, one of which was occupied by
guests who were finishing their meal. On the walls had been drawn, like a
fresco, a gastronomical and tourist map of Italy, in soft, ice cream colors:
vanilla, raspberry, and pistachio. It reminded O that she wanted to order ice
cream for dessert, with lots of almonds and whipped cream. For she was feeling
light and happy, Ren&eacute;'s knee was touching her knee beneath the table,
and whenever he spoke she knew he was talking for her ears alone. He too was
observing her lips. They let her have the ice cream, but not the coffee. Sir
Stephen invited O and Ren&eacute; to have coffee at his place. They all dined
very lightly, and O realized that they had been careful to drink very little,
and had kept her from virtually drinking at all: half a liter of Chianti for
the three of them. They had also dined very quickly: it was barely nine
o'clock. </P>
<P>&quot;I sent the chauffeur home,&quot; said Sir Stephen. &quot;Would you
drive, Ren&eacute;. The simplest thing would be to go straight to my
house.&quot; </P>
<P>Ren&eacute; took the wheal. O sat beside him, and Sir Stephen was next to
her. The car was a big Buick, there was ample room for three people in the
front seat. </P>
<P>After the Alma intersection, the Cours la Reine was visible because trees
were bare, and the Place de la Concorde sparkling and dry with, above it, the
sort of sky which promises snow, but from which snow has not yet fallen. O
heard a little click and felt the warm air rising around her legs: Sir Stephen
had turned on the heater. Ren&eacute; was still keeping to the Right Bank of
the Seine, then he turned at the Pont Royal to cross over to the Left Bank:
between its stone yokes, the water looked as frozen as the stone, and just as
black. O thought of hematites, which are black. When she was fifteen her best
friend, who was then thirty and with whom she was in love, wore a hematite ring
set in a cluster of tiny diamonds. O would have liked a necklace of those black
stones, without diamonds, a tight-fitting necklace, perhaps even a choker. But
the necklaces that were given to her now - no they were not given to her -
would she exchange them for the necklace of hematites, for the hematites of the
dream? She saw again the wretched room where Marion had taken her, behind the
Turbigo intersection, and remembered how she had untied - she, not Marion - her
two big schoolgirl pigtails when Marion had undressed her and laid her down on
the iron bed. How lovely Marion was when she was being caressed, and it's true
that eyes can resemble stars; hers looked like quivering blue stars. </P>
<P>Ren&eacute; stopped the car. O did not recognize the little street, one of
the cross streets which joins the rue de l'Universite and the rue de Lille. 
</P>
<P>Sir Stephen's apartment was situated at the far end of a courtyard, in one
wing of an old private mansion, and the rooms were laid out in a straight line,
one opening into the next. The room at the very end was also the largest, and
the most reposing, furnished in dark English mahogany and pale yellow and gray
silk drapes. </P>
<P>&quot;I shan't ask you to tend the fire,&quot; Sir Stephen said to O,
&quot;but this sofa is for you. Please sit down, Ren&eacute; will make coffee.
I would be most grateful if you would hear what I have to say.&quot; </P>
<P>The large sofa of light-colored Damascus silk was set at right angles to the
fireplace, facing the windows which overlooked the garden and with its back to
those behind, which looked onto the courtyard. O took off her fur and lay it
over the back of the sofa. When she turned around, she noticed that her lover
and her host were standing, waiting for her to accept Sir Stephen's invitation.
She set her bag down next to her fur and unbuttoned her gloves. When, would she
ever learn, and would she ever learn, a gesture stealthy enough so that when
she lifted her skirt no would notice, so that she could forget her nakedness,
her submission? Not, in any case, as long as Ren&eacute; and that stranger were
staring at her in silence, as they were presently doing. Finally she gave in.
Sir Stephen stirred the fire, Ren&eacute; suddenly went behind the sofa and,
seizing O by the throat and the hair, pulled her head down against the couch
and kissed her on the mouth, a kiss so prolonged and profound that she gasped
for breath and could feel her loins melting and burning. He let her go only
long enough to tell her that he loved her, and then immediately took her again.
O's hands, overturned in a gesture of utter abandon and defeat, her palms
upward, lay quietly on her black dress that spread like a corolla around her.
Sir Stephen had come nearer, and when at last Ren&eacute; let her go and she
opened her eyes, it was the gray, unflinching gaze of the Englishman which she
encountered. </P>
<P>Completely stunned and bewildered, as she still was, and gasping with joy,
she none the less was easily able to see that he was admiring her, and that he
desired her. Who could have resisted her moist, half-open mouth, with its full
lips, the white stalk of her arching neck against the black collar of her
pageboy jacket, her eyes large and clear, which refused to be evasive? But the
only gesture Sir Stephen allowed himself was to run his fingers over her
eyebrows, then over her lips. Then he sat down facing her on the opposite side
of the fireplace, and when Ren&eacute; had also sat down in an armchair, he
began to speak. </P>
<P>&quot;I don't believe Ren&eacute; has ever spoken to you about his
family,&quot; he said. &quot;Still, perhaps you do know that his mother, before
she married his father, had previously been married to an Englishman, who had a
son from his first marriage. I am that son, and it was she who raised me, until
she left my father. So Ren&eacute; and I are not actually relatives, and yet,
in a way, we are brothers. That Ren&eacute; loves you I have no doubt. I would
have known even if he hadn't told me, even if he hadn't made a move: all one
has to do is to see the way he looks at you. I know too that you are among
those girls who have been to Roissy, and i imagine you'll be going back again.
In principle, the ring you're wearing gives me the right to do with you what I
will, as it does to all those men who know its meaning. But that involves
merely a fleeting assignation, and what we expect from you is more serious. I
say 'we' because, as you see, Ren&eacute; is saying nothing: he prefers to have
me speak for both of us. </P>
<P>&quot;If we are brothers, I am the eldest, ten years older than he. There is
also between us a freedom so absolute and of such long standing that what
belongs to me has always belonged to him, and what belongs to him has likewise
belonged to me. Will you agree to join with us? I beg of you to, and I ask you
to swear to it because it will involve more than your submission, which I know
we can count on. Before you reply, realize for a moment that I am only, and can
only be, another form of your lover: you will still have only one master. A
more formidable one, I grand you, than the men to whom you were surrendered at
Roissy, because I shall be there every day, and besides I am fond of habits and
rites....&quot; (This last phrase he uttered in English.) </P>
<P>Sir Stephen's quit, self-assured voice rose in an absolute silence. Even the
flames in the fireplace flickered noiselessly. O was frozen to the sofa like a
butterfly impaled upon a pin, a long pin composed of words and looks which
pierced the middle of her body and pressed her naked, attentive loins against
the warm silk. She was no longer mistress of her breasts, her hands, the nape
of her neck. But of this much she was sure: the object of the habits and rites
of which he had spoken were patently going to be the possession of (among other
parts of her body) her long thighs concealed beneath the black skirt, her
already opened thighs. </P>
<P>Both men were sitting across from her. Ren&eacute; was smoking, but before
he had lighted his cigarette he had lighted one of those black-hooded lamps
which consumes the smoke, and the air, already purified by the wood fire,
smelled of the cool odors of the night. </P>
<P>&quot;Will you give me an answer, or would you like to know more?&quot; Sir
Stephen repeated. </P>
<P>&quot;If you give your consent,&quot; Ren&eacute; said, &quot;I'll
personally explain to you Sir Stephen's preferences.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Demands,&quot; Sir Stephen corrected. </P>
<P>The hardest thing, O was thinking, was not the question of giving her
consent, and she realized that never for a moment did either of them dream that
she might refuse; nor for that matter did she. The hardest thing was simply to
speak. Her lips were burning and her mouth was dry, all her saliva was gone, an
anguish both of fear and desire constricted her throat, and her new-found hands
were cold and moist. If only she could have closed her eyes. But she could not.
Two gazes talked her eyes, gazes from which she could not - and did not desire
to - escape. They drew her toward something she thought she had left behind for
a long time, perhaps forever, at Roissy. For since her return, Ren&eacute; had
taken her only by caresses, and the symbol signifying that she belonged to
anyone who knew the secret of her ring had been without consequence: either she
had not met anyone who was familiar with the secret, or else those who had
remained silent - the only person she suspected was Jacqueline (and if
Jacqueline had been at Roissy, why wasn't she also wearing the ring? Besides,
what right did Jacqueline's knowledge of this secret give her over O, and did
it, in fact give her any?). In order to speak, did she have to move? But she
could not move of her own free will - an order from them would immediately have
made her get up, but this time what they w anted from he was not blind
obedience, acquiescence to an order, they wanted her to anticipate orders, to
judge herself a slave and surrender herself as such. This, then, is what they
called her consent. She remembered that she had never told Ren&eacute; anything
but &quot;I love you&quot; or &quot;I'm yours.&quot; Today it seemed that they
wanted her to speak and to agree to, specifically and in detail, what till now
she had only tacitly consented to. </P>
<P>Finally she straightened up and, as though what she was going to say was
stifling her, unfastened the top hooks of her tunic, until the cleavage of her
breasts was visible. Then she stood up. Her hands and her knees were shaking. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'm yours,&quot; she said at length to Ren&eacute;. &quot;I'll be
whatever you want me to be.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; he broke in, &quot;ours. Repeat after me: I belong to both
of you. I shall be whatever both of you want me to be.&quot; </P>
<P>Sir Stephen's piercing gray eyes were fixed firmly upon hers, as were
Ren&eacute;'s, and in them she was lost, slowly repeating after him the phrases
he was dictating to her, but like a lesson of grammar, she was transposing them
into the first person. </P>
<P>&quot;To Sir Stephen and to me you grand the right...&quot; The right to
dispose of her body however they wished, in whatever place or manner they
should choose, the right to keep her in chains, the right to whip her like a
slave or prisoner for the slightest failing or infraction, or simply for their
pleasure, the right to pay no heed to her pleas and cries, if they should make
her cry out. </P>
<P>&quot;I believe,&quot; said Ren&eacute;, &quot;that at this point Sir
Stephen would like me to take over, both you and I willing, and have me brief
you concerning his demands.&quot; </P>
<P>O was listening to her lover, and the words which he had spoken to her at
Roissy came back to her: they were almost the same words. But then she had
listened snuffled up against him, protected by a feeling of improbability, as
though it were all a dream, as though she existed only in another life, and
perhaps did not really exist at all. Dream or nightmare, the prison setting,
the lavish party gowns, men in masks: all this removed from her own life, even
to the point of being uncertain how long it would last. There, at Roissy, she
felt the way you do at night, lost in a dream you have had before and are now
beginning to dream all over again: certain that it exists and certain that it
will end, and you want it to end because you're not sure you'll be able to bear
it, and you also want it to go on so you'll know how it comes out. Well the end
was here, where she least expected it (or no longer expected it at all) and in
the form she least expected (assuming, she was saying to herself, that this
really was the end, that there was not actually another hiding behind this one,
and perhaps still another behind the next one). The present end was toppling
her from memory into reality and, besides, what had only been reality in a
closed circle, a private universe, was suddenly about to contaminate all the
customs and circumstances of her daily life, but on her and within her, now no
longer satisfied with signs and symbols - the bare buttocks, bodices that
unhook, the iron ring - but demanding fulfillment. </P>
<P>It was true that Ren&eacute; had never whipped her, and the only difference
between the period of their relationship prior to his taking her to Roissy and
the time elapsed since her return was that now he used both her backside and
mouth the way he formerly had used only her womb (which he continued to use).
She had never been able to tell whether the floggings she had regularly
received at Roissy had been administered, were it only once, by him (whenever
there was any question about it, that is when she herself had been blindfolded
or when those with whom she was dealing were masked), but she tended to doubt
it. The pleasure he derived from the spectacle of her body bound and
surrendered, struggling vainly, and of her cries, was doubtless so great that
he could not bear the idea of lending a hand himself and thus having his
attention distracted from it. It was as though he were admitting it, since he
was now saying to her, so gently, so tenderly, without moving from the deep
armchair in which he was half reclining with his legs crossed, he was saying
how happy he was that she was handing <I>herself</I> over to, the commands and
desires of Sir Stephen. Whenever Sir Stephen would like her to spend the night
at his place, or only an hour, or if he should want her to accompany him
outside Paris or, in Paris itself, to join him at some restaurant or for some
show, he would telephone her and send his car for her - unless Ren&eacute;
himself came to pick her up. Today, now, it was her turn to speak. Did she
consent? But words failed her. This willful assent they were suddenly asking
her to express was the agreement to surrender herself, to say yes in advance to
everything to which she most assuredly wanted to say yes but to which her body
said no, at least insofar as the whipping was concerned. As for the rest, if
she were honest with herself, she would have to admit to a feeling of both
anxiety and excitement caused by what she read in Sir Stephen's eyes, a feeling
too intense for her to delude herself, and as she was trembling like a leaf,
and perhaps for the very reason that she was trembling, she knew that she was
waiting more impatiently than he for the moment when he would place his hand,
and perhaps his lips, upon her. It was probably up to her to hasten the moment.
Whatever courage, or whatever surge of overwhelming desire she may have had,
she felt herself suddenly grow so weak as she was about to reply that she
slipped to the floor, her dress in full bloom around her, and in the silence
Sir Stephen's hollow voice remarked that fear was becoming to her too. His
words were not intended for her, but for Ren&eacute;. O had the feeling that he
was restraining himself from advancing upon her, and regretted his restraint.
And yet she avoided his gaze, her eyes fixed upon Ren&eacute;, terrified lest
he should see what was in her eyes and perhaps deem it as a betrayal. And yet
it was not betrayal, for if she were to weigh her desire to belong to Sir
Stephen against her belonging to Ren&eacute;, she would not have had a second's
hesitation: the only reason she was yielding to this desire was that
Ren&eacute; had allowed her to and, to a certain extent, given her to
understand that he was ordering her to. And yet there was still a lingering
doubt in her mind as to whether Ren&eacute; might not be annoyed to see her
acquiesce too quickly or too well. The slightest sign from him would obliterate
it immediately. But he made no sign, confining himself to ask her for the third
time for an answer. She mumbled: </P>
<P>&quot;I consent to whatever you both desire,&quot; and lowered her eyes
toward her hands, which were waiting unclasped in the hollows of her knees,
then added in a murmur: &quot;I should like to know whether I shall be
whipped....&quot; </P>
<P>There was a long pause, during which she regretted twenty times over having
asked the question. Then Sir Stephen's voice said slowly: </P>
<P>&quot;From time to time.&quot; </P>
<P>Then O heard a match being struck and the sound of glasses: both men were
probably helping themselves to another round of whisky. Ren&eacute; was leaving
O to her own devices. Ren&eacute; was saying nothing. </P>
<P>&quot;Even if I agree to it now,&quot; she said, &quot;even if I promise
now, I couldn't bear it.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;All we ask you to do is submit to it, and if you scream or moan, to
agree ahead of time that it will be in vain,&quot; Sir Stephen went on. </P>
<P>&quot;Oh, please, for pity's sake, not yet!&quot; said O, for Sir Stephen
was getting to his feet, Ren&eacute; was following suit, he leaned down and
took her by the shoulders. </P>
<P>&quot;So give us your answer,&quot; he said. &quot;Do you consent?&quot; 
</P>
<P>Finally she said that she did. Gently he helped her up and, having sat down
on the big sofa, made her kneel down alongside him facing the sofa, on which
reclined her outstretched arms, her bust, and her head. Her eyes were closed,
and an image she had seen several years before flashed across her mind: a
strange print portraying a woman kneeling, as she was, before an armchair. The
floor was of tile, and in one corner a dog and child were playing. The woman's
skirts were raised, and standing close beside her was a man brandishing a
handful of switches, ready to whip her. They were all dressed in
sixteenth-century clothes, and the print bore a title which she found
disgusting: <I>Family Punishment</I>. </P>
<P>With one hand, Ren&eacute; took her wrists in a viselike grip, and with the
other lifted her skirts so high that she could feel the muslin lining brush her
cheek. He caressed her flanks and drew Sir Stephen's attention to the two
dimples that graced them, and the softness of the furrow between her thighs.
Then with that same hand he pressed her waist, to accentuate further her
buttocks, and ordered her to pen her knees wider. She obeyed without saying a
word. The honors Ren&eacute; was bestowing upon her body, and Sir Stephen's
replies, and the coarseness of the terms the men were using so overwhelmed her
with a shame as violent as it was unexpected that the desire she had felt to be
had by Sir Stephen vanished and she began to wish for the whip as a
deliverance, for the pain and screams as a justification. But Sir Stephen's
hands pried open her again, caressed her until she moaned. She was vanquished,
undone, and humiliated that she had moaned. </P>
<P>&quot;I leave you to Sir Stephen,&quot; Ren&eacute; then said. &quot;Remain
the way you are, he'll dismiss you when he sees fit.&quot; </P>
<P>How often had she remained like this at Roissy, on her knees, offered to one
and all? But then she had always had her hands bound together by the bracelets,
a happy prisoner upon whom everything was imposed and from whom nothing was
asked. Her it was through her own free will that she remained half naked,
whereas a single gesture, the same that would have sufficed to bring her back
to her feet, would also have sufficed to cover her. Her promise bound her as
much as had the leather bracelets and chains. Was it only the promise? And
however humiliated she was, or rather because she had been humiliated, was it
not somehow pleasant to be esteemed only for her humiliation, for the meekness
with which she surrendered, for the obedient way in which she opened? </P>
<P>With Ren&eacute; gone, Sir Stephen having escorted him to the door, she
waited thus alone, motionless, feeling more exposed in the solitude and more
prostituted by the wait than she had ever felt before, when they were there.
The gray and yellow silk of the sofa was smooth to her cheek; through her nylon
stockings she felt, below her knees, the thick wool rug, and along the full
length of her left thigh, the warmth from the fireplace hearth, for Sir Stephen
had added three logs which were blazing noisily. Above a chest of drawers, an
antique clock ticked so quietly that it was only audible when everything around
was silent. O listened carefully, thinking how absurd her position was in this
civilized, tasteful living room. Through the Venetian blinds could be heard the
sleepy rumbling of Paris after midnight. In the light of day, tomorrow morning,
would she recognize the spot on the sofa cushion where she had laid her head?
Would she ever return, in broad daylight, to this same living room, would she
ever be treated in the same way here? </P>
<P>Sir Stephen was apparently in no hurry to return, and O, who had waited so
submissively for the strangers of Roissy to take their pleasure, now felt a
lump rise in her throat at the idea that in one minute, in ten minutes, he
would again put his hands on her. But it was not exactly as she had imagined
it. </P>
<P>She heard him open the door and cross the room. He remained for some time
with his back to the fire, studying O, then in a near whisper he told her to
get up and then sit back down. Surprised, almost embarrassed, she obeyed. He
courteously brought her a glass of whisky and a cigarette, both of which she
refused. Then she saw that he was in a dressing gown, a very conservative
dressing gown of gray homespun - a gray that matched his hair. His hands were
long and dry and his flat fingernails, cut short, were very white. He caught
her staring, and O blushed: these were indeed the same hands which had seized
her body, the hands she now dreaded, and desired. But he did not approach her. 
</P>
<P>&quot;I'd like you to get completely undressed,&quot; he said. &quot;But
first simply undo your jacket, without getting up.&quot; </P>
<P>O unhooked the large gold hooks and slipped her close-fitting jacket down
over her shoulders; then she put it at the other end of the sofa, where her
fur, her gloves, and her bag were. </P>
<P>&quot;Caress the tips of your breasts, ever so lightly,&quot; Sir Stephen
said then, before adding: &quot;You must use a darker rouge, yours is too
light.&quot; </P>
<P>Taken completely aback, O fondled her nipples with her fingertips and felt
them stiffen and rise. She covered them with her palms. </P>
<P>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; Sir Stephen said. </P>
<P>She withdrew her hands and lay back against the back of the couch: her
breasts were heavy for so slender a torso, and, parting, rose gently toward her
armpits. The nape of her neck was resting against the back of the sofa, and her
hands were lying on either side of her hips. Why did Sir Stephen not bend over,
bring his mouth close to hers, why did his hands not move toward the nipples
which he had seen stiffen and which she, being absolutely motionless, could
feel quiver whenever she took a breath. But he had drawn near, had sat down
across the arm of the sofa, and was not touching her. He was smoking, and a
movement of his hand - O never knew whether or not it was voluntary - flicked
some still-warm ashes down between her breasts. She had the feeling he wanted
to insult her, by his disdain, his silence, by a certain attitude of
detachment. Yet he had desired her a while ago, he still did now, she could see
it by the tautness beneath the soft material of his dressing gown. Then let him
take her, if only to wound her! O hated herself for her own desire, and loathed
Sir Stephen for the self-control he was displaying. She wanted him to love her,
there, the truth was out: she wanted him to be chafing under the urge to touch
her lips and penetrate her body, to devastate her if need be, but not to remain
so calm and self-possessed. At Roissy, she had not cared in the slightest
whether those who had used her had any feeling whatsoever: they were the
instruments by which her lover derived pleasure from her, by which she became
what he wanted her to be, polished and smooth and gentle as a stone. Their
hands were his hands, their order his order. But not here. Ren&eacute; had
turned her over to Sir Stephen, but it was clear that he wanted to share her
with him, not to obtain anything further from her, nor for the pleasure of
surrendering her, but in order to share with Sir Stephen what today he loved
most, as no doubt in days gone by, when they were young, they had shared a
trip, a boat, a horse. </P>
<P>And today, this sharing derived the meaning from Ren&eacute;'s relation to
Sir Stephen much more than it did from his relation to her. What each of them
would look for in her would be the other's mark, the trace of the other's
passage. Only a short while before, when she had been kneeling half-naked
before Ren&eacute;, and Sir Stephen had opened her thighs with both his hands,
Ren&eacute; had explained to Sir Stephen why O's buttocks were so easily
accessible, and why he was pleased that they had been thus prepared: it was
because it had occurred to him that Sir Stephen would enjoy having his
preferred path constantly at his disposal. He had even added that, if Sir
Stephen wished, he would grant him the sole use of it. </P>
<P>&quot;Why, gladly,&quot; Sir Stephen had said, but he had remarked that, in
spite of everything, there was a risk that he might rend O. </P>
<P>&quot;O is yours,&quot; Ren&eacute; had replied, &quot;O will be pleased to
be rent.&quot; </P>
<P>And he had leaned down over her and kissed her hands. </P>
<P>The very idea that Ren&eacute; could imagine giving up any part of her left
O stunned. She had taken it as the sign that her lover cared more about Sir
Stephen than he did about her. And too, although he had so often told her that
what he loved in her was the object he had made of her, her absolute
availability to him, his freedom with respect to her, as one is free to dispose
of a piece of furniture, which one enjoys giving as much as, and sometimes even
more than, one may enjoy keeping it for oneself, she realized that she had not
believed him completely. </P>
<P>She saw another sign of what could scarcely be termed anything but a certain
deference or respect toward Sir Stephen, in the fact that Ren&eacute;, who so
passionately loved to see her beneath the bodies or the blows of others beside
himself, whose look was one of constant tenderness, of unflagging gratitude
whenever he saw her mouth open to moan or scream, her eyes closed over tears,
had left her after having made certain, by exposing her to him, by opening her
as one opens a horse's mouth to prove that it is young enough, that Sir Stephen
found her beautiful enough or, strictly speaking, suitable enough for him, and
vouchsafed to accept her. However offensive and insulting his conduct may have
been, O's love for Ren&eacute; remained unchanged. She considered herself
fortunate to count enough in his eyes for him to derive pleasure from offending
her, as believers give thanks to God for humbling them. </P>
<P>But, in Sir Stephen, she thought she detected a will of ice and iron, which
would not be swayed by desire, a will in whose judgement, no matter how moving
and submissive she might be, she counted for absolutely nothing, at least till
now. Otherwise why should she have been so frightened? The whip at the valets'
belt at Roissy, the chains borne almost constantly had seemed to her less
terrifying than the equanimity of Sir Stephen's gaze as it fastened on the
breasts he refrained from touching. She realized to what extent their very
fullness, smooth and distended on her tiny shoulders and slender torso,
rendered them fragile. She could not keep them from trembling, she would have
had to stop breathing. To hope that this fragility would disarm Sir Stephen was
futile, and she was fully aware that it was quite the contrary: her proffered
gentleness cried for wounds as much as caresses, fingernails as much as lips.
She had a momentary illusion: Sir Stephen's right hand, which was holding his
cigarette, grazed their tips with the end of his middle finger and, obediently,
they stiffened further. That this, for Sir Stephen, was a game, or the guise of
a game, nothing more, or a check, the way one checks to ascertain whether a
machine is functioning properly, O had no doubt. </P>
<P>Without moving from the arm of his chair, Sir Stephen then told her to take
off her skirt. O's moist hands made the hooks slippery, and it took her two
tries before she succeeded in undoing the black faille petticoat under her
skirt. </P>
<P>When she was completely naked, her high-heeled patent-leather sandals and
her black nylon stockings rolled down flat above her knees, accentuating the
delicate lines of her legs and the whiteness of thighs, Sir Stephen, who had
also gotten to his feet, seized her loins with one hand and pushed her toward
the sofa. He had her kneel down, her back against the sofa, and to make her
press more tightly against it with her shoulders than with her waist, he made
her spread her thighs slightly. Her hands were lying on her ankles, thus
forcing her belly ajar, and above her still proffered breasts, her throat
arched back. </P>
<P>She did not dare look Sir Stephen in the face, but she saw his hands undoing
his belt. When he had straddled O, who was still kneeling, and had seized her
by the nape of her neck, he drove into her mouth. It was not the caress of her
lips the length of him he was looking for, but the back of her throat. For a
long time he probed, and O felt the suffocating gag of flesh swell and harden,
its slow repeated hammering finally bringing her to tears. In order to invade
her better, Sir Stephen ended by kneeling on the sofa, one knee on each side of
her face, and there were moments when his buttocks rested on O's breast, and in
her heart she felt her womb, useless and scorned, burning her. Although he
delighted and reveled in her for a long time, Sir Stephen did not bring his
pleasure to a climax, but withdrew from her in silence and rose again to his
feet, without closing his dressing gown. </P>
<P>&quot;You are easy, O,&quot; he said to her. &quot;You love Ren&eacute;, but
you're easy. Does Ren&eacute; realize that you covet and long for all the men
who desire you, that by sending you to Roissy or surrendering you to others he
is providing you with a string of alibis to cover your easy virtue?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;I love Ren&eacute;,&quot; O replied. </P>
<P>&quot;You love Ren&eacute;, but you desire me, among others,&quot; Sir
Stephen went on. </P>
<P>Yes, she did desire him, but what if Ren&eacute;, upon learning it, were to
change? All she could do was remain silent and lower her eyes: even to have
looked Sir Stephen directly in the eyes would have been tantamount to a
confession. </P>
<P>Then Sir Stephen bent down over her and, taking her by the shoulders, made
her slide down onto the rug. Again she was on her back, her legs raised and
doubled up against her. Sir Stephen, who had sat down on the part of the couch
against which she had just been leaning, seized her right knee and pulled her
toward him. Since she was facing the fireplace, the light from the nearby
hearth shed a fierce light upon the double, quartered furrow of her belly and
rear. Without loosing his grip, Sir Stephen abruptly ordered her to caress
herself, without closing her legs. Startled, O meekly stretched her right hand
toward her loins, where her fingers encountered the ridge of flesh - already
emerging from the protective fleece beneath, already burning - where her
belly's fragile lips merged. </P>
<P>But her hand recoiled and she mumbled: </P>
<P>&quot;I can't.&quot; </P>
<P>And in fact she could not. The only times she had ever caressed herself
furtively had been in the warmth and obscurity of her bed, when she slept
alone, but she had never tried to carry it to a climax. But later she would
sometimes come upon it in her sleep and would wake up disappointed that it had
been so intense and yet so fleeting. </P>
<P>Sir Stephen's gaze was persistent. She could not bear it, and repeating
&quot;I can't,&quot; she closed her eyes. </P>
<P>What she was seeing in her mind's eye, what she had never been able to
forget, what still filled her with the same sensation of nausea and disgust
that she had felt when she had first witnessed it when she was fifteen, was the
image of Marion slumped in the leather armchair in a hotel room, Marion with
one leg sprawled over one arm of the chair and her head half hanging over the
other, caressing herself in her, O's, presence, and moaning. Marion had related
to her how she had one day caressed herself this way in her office when she had
thought she was alone, and her boss had happened to walk in and caught her in
the act. </P>
<P>O remembered Marion's office, a bare room with pale green walls, with the
north light filtering in through dusty windows. There was only one easy chair,
intended for visitors, facing the table. </P>
<P>&quot;Did you run away?&quot; O had asked. </P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; Marion had answered, &quot;he asked me to begin all over
again, but he locked the door, made me take off my panties, and pushed the
chair over in front of the window.&quot; </P>
<P>O had been overwhelmed with admiration - and with horror - for what she took
to be Marion's courage, and had steadfastly refused to fondle herself in
Marion's presence and sworn that she never would, in anyone's presence. Marion
had laughed and said: </P>
<P>&quot;You'll see. Wait till your lover asks you to.&quot; </P>
<P>Ren&eacute; never had asked her to. Would she have obeyed? Yes, of course
she would, but she would also have been terrified at the thought that she might
see Ren&eacute;'s eyes filling with the same disgust that she had felt for
Marion. Which was absurd. And since it was Sir Stephen, it was all the more
absurd; what did she care whether Sir Stephen was disgusted? But no, she
couldn't. For the third time she murmured: </P>
<P>&quot;I can't.&quot; </P>
<P>Though she uttered the words in almost a whisper, he heard them, let her go,
rose to his feet, closed his dressing gown, and ordered O to get up. </P>
<P>&quot;Is this your obedience?&quot; he said. </P>
<P>Then he caught both her wrists with his left hand, and with his right he
slapped her on both sides of the face. She staggered, and would have fallen had
he not held her up. </P>
<P>&quot;Kneel down and listen to me,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm afraid
Ren&eacute;'s training leave a great deal to be desired.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;I always obey Ren&eacute;,&quot; she mumbled. </P>
<P>&quot;You're confusing love and obedience. You'll obey me without loving me,
and without my loving you.&quot; </P>
<P>With that, she felt a strange inexplicable storm of revolt rising within
her, silently denying in the depths of her being the words she was hearing,
denying her promises of submission and slavery, denying her own agreement, her
own desire, her nakedness, her sweat, her trembling limbs, the circles under
her eyes. She struggled and clenched her teeth with rage when, having made her
bend over, with her elbows on the floor and her head between her arms, her
buttocks raised, he forced her from behind, to rend her as Ren&eacute; had said
he would. </P>
<P>The first time she did not cry out. He went at it again, harder now, and she
screamed. She screamed as much out of revolt as of pain, and he was fully aware
of it. She also knew - which meant that in any event she was vanquished - that
he was pleased to make her cry out. When he had finished with her, and after he
had helped her to her feet, he was on the point of dismissing her when he
remarked to her that what he had spilled in her was going to seep slowly out,
tinted with the blood of the wound he had inflicted on her, that this wound
would burn her as long as her buttocks were not used to him and he was obliged
to keep forcing his way. Ren&eacute; had reserved this particular use of her to
him, and he certainly intended to make full use of it, she had best have no
illusions on that score. He reminded her that she had agreed to be
Ren&eacute;'s slave, and his too, but that it appeared unlikely that she was
aware - consciously aware - of what she had consented to. By the time she had
learned, it would be too late for her to escape. </P>
<P>Listening, O told herself that perhaps it would also be too late for him to
escape becoming enamored of her, for she had no intention of being quickly
tamed, and by the time she was he might have learned to love her a little. For
all her inner resistance, and the timid refusal she had dared to display, had
one object and one object alone: she wanted to exist for Sir Stephen in however
modest a way, in the same way she existed for Ren&eacute;, and wanted him to
feel something more than desire for her. Not that she was in love, but because
she clearly saw that Ren&eacute; loved Sir Stephen in that passionate way boys
love their elders, and she sensed that he was ready, if need be, to sacrifice
her to any and all of Sir Stephen's whims, in an effort to satisfy him. She
knew with an infallible intuition that that Ren&eacute; would follow Sir
Stephen's example and emulate his attitude, and that if Sir Stephen were to
show contempt for her Ren&eacute; would be contaminated by it, no matter how
much he loved her, contaminated in a way he had never been, or had dreamed of
being, by the opinions and example of the men at Roissy. This was because at
Roissy, with regard to her, he was the master, and the opinions of all the men
there to whom he gave her derived from and depended on his own. Here he was not
the master any longer. On the contrary, Sir Stephen was Ren&eacute;'s master,
without Ren&eacute;'s being fully aware of it, which is to say that Ren&eacute;
admired him and wanted to emulate him, to compete with him, and why he had
given O to him: this time it was apparent that she had been given with no
strings attached. Ren&eacute; would probably go on loving her insofar as Sir
Stephen deemed that she was worth the trouble and would love her himself. Till
then, it was clear that Sir Stephen would be her master and, regardless of what
Ren&eacute; might think, her only master, in the precise relationship of master
to slave. She did not expect any pity from him; but could she not hope to wrest
some slight feeling of love from him? </P>
<P>Sprawled in the same big armchair next to the fire, which he had been
occupying before Ren&eacute;' departure, he had left her standing there naked
and told her to await his further orders. She had waited without saying a word.
Then he had got to his feet and told her to follow him. Still naked, except for
her high-heeled sandals and black stockings, she had followed him up a flight
of stairs which went from the ground-floor landing, and entered a small
bedroom, a room so tiny there was only space enough for a bed in one corner and
a dressing table and chair between the bed and window. This small room
communicated with a larger room, which was Sir Stephen's, with a common
bathroom between. </P>
<P>O washed and wiped herself - the towel was faintly stained with pink -
removed her sandals and stockings, and crawled in between the cold sheets. The
curtains of the window were open, but the night was dark. </P>
<P>Before he closed the door between their rooms, after O was already in bed,
Sir Stephen came over to her and kissed her fingertips, as he had done when she
had slipped down her stool in the bar and he had complimented her on her iron
ring. Thus, he had thrust his hands and sex into her, ransacked and ravaged her
mouth and rear, but condescended only to place his lips upon her fingertips. O
wept, and did not fall asleep until dawn. </P>

<IMG SRC="images/crop2.gif"> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <P>&nbsp; </P>
<P>The following day, a little before noon, Sir Stephen's chauffeur drove O
home. She had awakened at ten, an elderly mulatto servant had brought her a cup
of coffee, prepared her bath, and given her her clothes, except for her fur
wrap, her gloves, and her bag, which she had found on the living-room couch
when she had gone downstairs. The living room was empty, the Venetian blinds
were raised, and the curtains were open. Through the window opposite the couch,
she could see a garden green and narrow as an aquarium, planed in nothing but
ivy, holly, and spindle hedges. </P>
<P>As she was putting on her coat, the mulatto servant told her that Sir
Stephen had left, and handed her an envelope on which there was nothing but her
initial; the white sheet inside consisted of two lines: &quot;Ren&eacute;
phoned that he would come by for you at the studio at six o'clock,&quot; signed
with and S and with a postscript: &quot;The riding crop is for your next
visit.&quot; </P>
<P>O glanced around her: on the table, between the two chairs in which Sir
Stephen and Ren&eacute; had been sitting the evening before, there was a long,
slender, leather riding crop near a vase of yellow roses. The servant was
waiting at the door. O put the letter in her bag and left. </P>
<P>So Ren&eacute; had phoned Sir Stephen, and not her. Back home, after having
taken off her clothes, and having had lunch in her dressing gown, she still had
plenty of time to freshen her make-up and rearrange her hair, and to get
dressed to go to the studio, where she was due at three o'clock. The telephone
did not ring; Ren&eacute; did not call her. Why? What had Sir Stephen told him?
How had they talked about her? She remembered the words they both had used in
her presence, their casual remarks concerning the advantages of her body with
respect to the demands of theirs. Perhaps it was merely that she was not used
to this kind of vocabulary in English, but the only French equivalents she
could find seemed utterly base and contemptible to her. It was true that she
had been passed from hand to hand as often as were the prostitutes in the
brothels, so why should they treat her otherwise? &quot;I love you, I love you,
Ren&eacute;,&quot; she repeated, softly calling to him in the solitude of her
room, &quot;&quot; love you, do whatever you want with me, but don't leave me,
for God's sake, don't leave me.&quot; </P>
<P>Who pities those who wait? They are easily recognized: by their gentleness,
by their falsely attentive looks - attentive, yes, but to something other than
what they are looking at - by their absent-mindedness. For three long hours, in
the studio where a short, plump red-haired model whom O did not know and who
was modeling hats for her, O was that absent-minded person, withdrawn into
herself by her desire for the minutes to hasten by, and by her own anxiety. 
</P>
<P>Over a blouse and petticoat of red silk she had put on a plaid skirt and a
short suede jacket. The bright red of her blouse beneath her partly opened
jacket made her already pale face seem even paler, and the little red-haired
model told her that she looked like a femme fatale. &quot;Fatal for whom?&quot;
O said to herself. </P>
<P>Two years earlier, before she had met and fallen in love with Ren&eacute;,
she would have sworn: &quot;Fatal for Sir Stephen&quot;, and have added:
&quot;and he'll know it too.&quot; But her love for Ren&eacute; and
Ren&eacute;'s love for her had stripped her of all her weapons, and instead of
providing her with any new proof of her power, had stripped her of those she
had previously possessed. Once she had been indifferent and fickle, someone who
enjoyed tempting, by a word or gesture, the boys who were in love with her, but
without giving them anything, then giving herself impulsively, for no reason,
once and only once, as a reward, but also to inflame then even more and render
a passion she did not share even more cruel. She was sure that they loved her.
One of them had tried to commit suicide; when he had been released from the
hospital where they had taken him, she had gone to his place, had stripped
naked, and forbidding him to touch her, had lain down on his couch. Pale with
pain and passion, he had stared at her silently for two hours, petrified by the
promise he had made. She had never wanted to see him again. It wasn't that she
took lightly the desire she aroused. She understood it, or thought she
understood, all the more so because she herself felt a similar desire (or so
she thought) for her girl friends, or for young strangers, girls she
encountered by chance. Some of them yielded to her, and she would take them to
some discreet hotel with its narrow hallways and paper-thin walls, while
others, horrified, spurned her. But what she took - or mistook - to be desire
was actually nothing more than the thirst for conquest, and neither her
tough-guy exterior nor the fact that she had had several lovers - if you could
call them lovers - nor her hardness, nor even her courage was of any help to
her when she had met Ren&eacute;. In the space of a week she learned fear, but
certainty; anguish, but happiness. Ren&eacute; threw himself at her like a
pirate at his prisoner, and she reveled in her captivity, feeling on her
wrists, her ankles, feeling on all her members and in the secret depths of her
heart and body, bonds less visible than the finest strands of hair, more
powerful than the cables the Lilliputians used to tie up Gulliver, bonds her
lover loosened or tightened with a glance. She was no longer free? Yes! Thank
God, she was no longer free. But she was light, a nymph on clouds, a fish in
water, lost in happiness. Lost because these fine strands of hair, these cables
which Ren&eacute; held, without exception in his hand, were the only network
through which the current of life any longer flowed into her. </P>
<P>This was true to such a degree that when Ren&eacute; relaxed his grip upon
her - or when she imagined he had - when he seemed distracted, when he left her
in a mood which she took to be indifference of let some time go by without
seeing her or replying to her letters and she assumed that he no longer cared
to see her and was on the verge of ceasing to love her, then everything was
choked and smothered within her. The grass turned black, day was no longer day
nor night any longer night, but both merely infernal machines which alternately
provided, as part of her torture, periods of light and darkness. Cool water
made her nauseous. She felt as though she were a statue of ashes - bitter,
useless, damned - like the salt statues of Gomorrah. For she was guilty. Those
who love God, and by Him are abandoned in the dark of night, are guilty
<I>because</I> they are abandoned. They cast back into their memories,
searching for their sins. She looked back, hunting for hers. All she found were
insignificant acts of kindness or self-indulgence, which were not so much acts
as an innate part of her personality, such as arousing the desires of men other
than Ren&eacute;, men she noticed only to the extent that the love Ren&eacute;
gave her, the certainty of belonging to Ren&eacute;, made her happy and filled
her cup of happiness to overflowing, and insofar as her total submission to
Ren&eacute; rendered her vulnerable, irresponsible, and all her trifling acts -
but what acts? For all she had to reproach herself with were thoughts and
fleeting temptations. Yet, he was certain that she was guilty and, without
really wanting to, Ren&eacute; was punishing her for a sin he knew nothing
about (since it remained completely internal), although Sir Stephen had
immediately detected it: her wantonness. </P>
<P>O was happy that Ren&eacute; had had her whipped and had prostituted her,
because her impassioned submission would furnish her lover with the proof that
she belonged to him, but also because the pain and shame of the lash, and the
outrage inflicted upon her by those who compelled her to pleasure when they
took her, and at the same time delighted in their own without paying the
slightest heed to hers, seemed to her the very redemption of her sins. There
had been embraces she had found foul, hands that had been an intolerable insult
on her breasts, mouths which had sucked on her lips and tongues like so many
soft, vile leeches, and tongues and sexes, viscous beasts which, caressing
themselves at her closed mouth, at the double furrow before and behind, which
she had squeezed tight with all her might, had stiffened her with disgust and
kept her stiffened so long that it was all the whip could do to unbend her, but
she had finally yielded to the blows and opened, with disgust and abominable
servility. And what if, in spite of that, Sir Stephen was right? What if she
actually enjoyed her debasement? In that case, the baser she was, the more
merciful was Ren&eacute; to consent to make O the instrument of his pleasure. 
</P>
<P>As a child, O had read a Biblical text in red letters on the white wall of a
room in Wales where she had lived for two months, a text such as the
Protestants often inscribe in their houses: </P>
<P>&nbsp; </P>

<CENTER>
<FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">INTO THE HANDS OF THE LIVING GOD</FONT> 
</CENTER>

<FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">&nbsp;</FONT> 
</CENTER>
<P>No, O told herself now, that isn't true. What is fearful is to be cast out
at the hands of the living God. Every time Ren&eacute; postponed, or was late
to, a rendezvous with her, as he had done today - for six o'clock had come and
gone, as had six-thirty - O was prey to a dual feeling of madness and despair,
but for nothing. Madness was nothing, despair for nothing, nothing was true.
Ren&eacute; would arrive, he would be there, nothing was changed, he loved her
but had been held up by a staff meeting or some extra work, he had not had time
to let her know; in a flash, O emerged from her airless chamber, and yet each
of these attacks of terror would leave behind, somewhere deep inside her, a
dull premonition, a warning of woe: for there were also times when Ren&eacute;
neglected to let her know when the reason for the delay was a game of golf or a
hand of bridge, or perhaps another face, for he loved O but he was free, sure
of her and fickle, so fickle. Would a day of death and ashes not come, a day in
the long string of other days which would give the nod to madness, a day when
the gas chamber would reopen? Oh, let the miracle continue, let me still be
touched by grace, Ren&eacute; don't leave me! Each day, O did not look, nor did
she care to look, any further than the next day and the day after; nor, each
week, any further than the following week. And for her every night with
Ren&eacute; was a night which would last forever. </P>
<P>Ren&eacute; finally arrived at seven, so happy to see her again that he
kissed her in front of the electrician who was repairing a floodlight, in front
of the short, red-haired model who was just coming out of the dressing room,
and in front of Jacqueline, whom on one expected, who had come in suddenly on
the heels of the other model. </P>
<P>&quot;What a lovely sight,&quot; Jacqueline said to O. &quot;I was just
passing. I wanted to ask you for the last shots of me you took, but I gather
this isn't the right moment. I'll be on my way.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Mademoiselle, please don't go,&quot; Ren&eacute; called after her,
without letting go of O, whom he was holding around the waist, &quot;please
don't go!&quot; </P>
<P>O introduced them: Jacqueline, Ren&eacute;; Ren&eacute;, Jacqueline. </P>
<P>Piqued, the red-haired model had gone back into her dressing room, the
electrician was pretending to be busy. O was looking at Jacqueline and could
feel Ren&eacute;'s eyes following her gaze. Jacqueline was wearing a ski
outfit, the kind that only movie stars who never go skiing wear. Her black
sweater accentuated her small, widely spaced breasts, her tight-fitting ski
pants did the same for her long, winter-sports-girl legs. Everything about her
looked like snow: the bluish sheen of her gray sealskin jacket was snow in the
shade; the hoar-frost reflection of her hair and eyelashes, snow in sunlight.
She had on lipstick whose deep red shaded almost to purple, and when she smiled
and lifted her eyes till they were fixed on O, O said to herself that no would
could resist the desire to drink of that green and moving water beneath the
silvery lashes, to rip off her sweater to lay his hands on the fairly small
breasts. There, you see: no sooner had Ren&eacute; returned than, completely
reassured by his presence, she recovered her taste for others and for herself,
her zest for life. </P>
<P>They left together, all thee of them. On the rue Royale the snow, which had
been falling in large flakes for two hours, fell now in eddies of thin little
flakes for two hours, fell now in eddies of thin little white flies which stung
the face. The rock salt scattered on the sidewalk crunched beneath their feet
and melted the snow, and O felt the icy breath it emitted rising along her legs
and fastened on her naked thighs. </P>
<P>&nbsp; </P>
<P> </P>
</bLOCKQUOTE>
</bLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="images/crop2.gif"> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <P>&nbsp; </P>
<P>O had a fairly clear idea of what she was looking for in the young women she
pursued. It wasn't that she wanted to give the impression she was vying with
men, nor that she was trying to compensate by her manifest masculinity for a
female inferiority which she in no wise felt. It's true that when she was
twenty she had caught herself courting the prettiest of her girl friends by
doffing her beret, by standing aside to let her pass, and by offering a hand to
help her out of a taxi. In the same vein, she would not tolerate not paying
whenever they had tea together in some pastry shop. She would kiss her hand
and, if she had a chance, her mouth, if possible in the street. But these were
so many affectations she paraded for the sake of scandal, displayed much more
from childishness than from conviction. On the other hand, her penchant for the
sweetness of sweetly made-up lips yielding beneath her own, for the porcelain
or pearly sparkle of eyes half-closed in the half-light of couches at five in
the afternoon, when the curtains are drawn and the lamp on the fireplace mantel
lighted, for the voices that say: &quot;Again, oh, please, again...,&quot; for
the marine odor clinging to her fingers: this was a real, deeply-rooted taste.
And she also enjoyed the pursuit just as much. Probably not for the pursuit
itself, however amusing or fascinating it might be, but for the complete sense
of freedom she experienced in the act of hunting. She, and she alone, set the
rules and directed the proceedings (something she never did with men, or only
in a most oblique manner). She initiated the discussions and set the
rendezvous, the kisses came from her too, so much so that she preferred not to
have someone kiss her first, and since she had first had lovers she almost
never allowed the girl whom she was caressing to return her caresses. As much
as she was in a hurry to behold her girlfriend naked, she was equally quick to
find excuses why she herself should not undress. She often looked for excuses
to avoid it, saying that she was cold, that it was the wrong time of the month
for her. And, what is more, rare was the woman in whom she failed to detect
some element of beauty. She remembered that, just out of the
<I>lyc&eacute;e</I>, she had tried to seduce an ugly, disagreeable, constantly
ill-natured little girl for the sole reason that she had a wild mop of blonde
hair which, by its unevenly cut curls, created a forest of light and shade over
a skin that, while lusterless, had a texture which was soft, smooth, and
totally flat. But the little girl had repelled her advances, and if one day
pleasure had ever lighted up the ungrateful wench's face, it had not been
because of O. For O passionately loved to see faces enveloped in that mist
which makes them so young and smooth, a timeless youth that does not restore
childhood but enlarges the lips, widens the eyes the way make-up does, and
renders the iris sparkling and clear. In this, admiration played a larger part
than pride, for it was not her handiwork which moved her: at Roissy she had
experienced the same uncomfortable feeling in the presence of the transfigured
face of a girl possessed by a stranger. The nakedness and surrender of the
bodies overwhelmed her, and she had the feeling that her girlfriends, when they
simply agreed to display themselves naked in a locked room, were giving her a
gift which she could never repay in kind. For the nakedness of vacations, in
the sun and on the beaches, made no impression on her - not simply because it
was public but because, being public and not absolute, she was to some extent
protected from it. The beauty of other women, which with unfailing generosity
she was inclined to find superior to her own, nevertheless reassured her
concerning her own beauty, in which she saw, whenever she unexpectedly caught a
glimpse of herself in a mirror, a kind of reflection of theirs. The power she
acknowledged that her girlfriends had over her was at the same time a guarantee
of her own power over men. And what she asked of women (and never returned, or
ever so little), she was happy and found it quite natural that men should be
eager and impatient to ask of her. Thus was she constantly and simultaneously
the accomplice of both men and women, having, as it were, her cake and eating
it too. There were times when the game was not all that easy. That O was in
love with Jacqueline, no more and no less than she had been in love with many
others, and assuming that the term &quot;in love&quot; (which was saying a
great deal) was the proper one, there could be no doubt. But why did she
conceal it so? </P>
<P>When the buds burst open on the poplar tree along the quays, and daylight,
lingering longer, gave lovers time to sit for a while in the gardens after
work, she thought she had at last found the courage to face Jacqueline. In
winter, Jacqueline had seemed too triumphant to her beneath her cool furs, too
iridescent, untouchable, inaccessible. And Jacqueline knew it. Spring put her
back into suits, flat-heeled shoes, sweaters. With her short Dutch bob, she
finally resembled those fresh school girls whom O, as a <I>lyc&eacute;e</I>
student herself, used to grab by the wrists and drag silently into an empty
cloakroom and push back against the hanging coats. The coats would tumble from
the hangars. Then O would burst out laughing. They used to wear uniform blouses
of raw cotton, with their initials embroidered in red cotton on their breast
pockets. Three years later, three kilometers away, Jacqueline had worn the same
blouses in another <I>lyc&eacute;e</I>. It was by chance that O learned that
one day when Jacqueline was modeling some high-fashion dresses and said with a
sigh that, really, if only they had had as pretty dresses at school, they would
have been much happier there. Or if they had been allowed to wear the jumper
they gave you, without anything on underneath. &quot;What do you mean, without
anything on?&quot; O said. &quot;Without a dress, naturally,&quot; Jacqueline
replied. To which O began to blush. She could not get used to being naked
beneath her dress, and any equivocal remark seemed to her to be an allusion to
her condition. It did no good to keep on repeating to herself that one is
always naked beneath one's clothes. No, she felt as naked as that woman from
Verona who went out to offer herself to the chief of the besieging army in
order to free her city: naked beneath a coat, which only needed to be opened a
crack. It also seemed to her that, like the Italian, her nakedness was meant to
redeem something. But what? Since Jacqueline was sure of herself, she had
nothing to redeem; she had no need to be reassured, all she needed was a
mirror. O looked at her humbly, thinking that the only flowers one could offer
her were magnolias, because their waxen whiteness is sometimes infused with a
pink glow. As winter waned, the pale tan that gilded Jacqueline's skin vanished
with the memory of the snow. Soon, only camellias would do. But O was afraid of
making a fool of herself with these melodramatic flowers. On day she brought a
big bouquet of blue hyacinths, whose odor is overwhelming, like that of
tuberoses: oily, cloying, clinging, exactly the odor camellias ought to have
but don't. Jacqueline buried her Mongolian nose in the warm, stiff-stemmed
flowers, her small nose and pink lips, for she had been wearing a pink lipstick
for the past two weeks, and not red any longer. </P>
<P>&quot;Are they for me?&quot; she said, the way women do who are used to
receiving gifts. </P>
<P>Then she thanked O and asked her if Ren&eacute; were coming for her. Yes, he
was coming, O said. He's coming, she repeated to herself, and it will be for
him that Jacqueline will lift her icy, liquid eyes for a second, those eyes
which never look at anyone squarely, as she stands there falsely motionless,
falsely silent. No on would need to tech her anything: neither to remain silent
nor now to keep her hands unclenched at her sides, nor indeed how to arch her
head half back. O was dying to seize a handful of that too blonde hair at the
nape of the neck, and pull her docile head all the way back, to run at least
her finger over the line of her eyebrows. But Ren&eacute; would want to do it
too. She was fully aware why she, once so daring and bold, had become so shy,
why she had wanted Jacqueline for two months without betraying it by the least
word or gesture, and giving herself lame excuses to explain her timidity. It
was not true that Jacqueline was intangible. The obstacle was not in
Jacqueline, it lay deep within O herself, its roots deeper than anything she
had ever before encountered. It was because Ren&eacute; was leaving her free,
and because she loathed her freedom. Her freedom was worse than any chains. Her
freedom was separating her from Ren&eacute;. She could have taken Jacqueline by
the shoulders any number of times and without saying a word, pinned her against
the wall with her two hands, the way a butterfly is impaled; Jacqueline would
not have moved, and probably not even done so much as smile. But O was
henceforth like those wild animals which have been taken captive and either
serve as decoys for the hunter or, leaping forward only at the hunter's
command, head off the game for him. </P>
<P>It was she who sometimes leaned back against a wall, pale and trembling,
stubbornly impaled by her silence, bound there by her silence, so happy to
remain silent. She was waiting for more than permission, since she already had
permission. She was waiting for an order. It cam to her not from Ren&eacute;,
but from Sir Stephen. </P>
<P>&nbsp; </P>

</bLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="images/crop2.gif"> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <P>&nbsp; </P>
<P>As the months went by since the day Ren&eacute; had given her to Sir
Stephen, O was terrified to note the growing importance Sir Stephen was
assuming in her lover's eyes. Moreover, she realized at the same time that, in
this matter, she was perhaps mistaken, imagining a progression in the fact or
the feeling where actually the only progression had been in the acknowledgment
of this fact or the admission of this feeling. Be that as it may, she had been
quick to note that Ren&eacute; chose to spend with her those nights, and only
those nights, following those she had spent with Sir Stephen (Sir Stephen
keeping her the whole night only when Ren&eacute; was away from Paris). She
also noticed that when Ren&eacute; remained for one of those evenings at Sir
Stephen's he would never touch O except to make her more readily available or
an easier offering to Sir Stephen, if she happened to be struggling. It was
extremely rare for him to stay, and he never did unless at Sir Stephen's
express request. Whenever he did, he remained fully dressed, as he had done the
first time, keeping quiet, lighting one cigarette after another, adding wood to
the fire, serving Sir Stephen something to drink - but not drinking himself. O
felt that he was watching her the way a lion trainer watches the animal he
trained, careful to see that it performs with complete obedience and thus does
honor to him, but even more the way a prince's bodyguard or a bandit's
second-in-command keeps an eye on the prostitute he has gone down to fetch in
the street. The proof that he was indeed yielding to the role of servant or
acolyte resided in the fact that he watched Sir Stephen's face more closely
than he did hers - and beneath his gaze O felt herself stripped of the very
voluptuousness in which her features were immersed: for this sensual pleasure
Ren&eacute; paid obeisance, expressed admiration and even gratitude to Sir
Stephen, who had engendered it, pleased that he had deigned to take pleasure in
something he had given him. </P>
<P>Everything would probably have been much simpler if Sir Stephen had liked
boys, and O did not doubt that Ren&eacute;, who was not so inclined, still
would have readily granted to Sir Stephen both the slightest and the most
demanding of his requests. But Sir Stephen only liked women. </P>
<P>O realized that through the medium of her body, shared between them, they
attained something more mysterious and perhaps more acute, more intense than an
amorous communion, the very conception of which was arduous but whose reality
and force she could not deny. Still, why was this division in a way abstract?
At Roissy, O had at the same time ad in the same place, belonged both to
Ren&eacute; and to other men. Why did Ren&eacute;, in Sir Stephen's presence,
refrain not only from taking her, but from giving her any order? (All he ever
did was pass on Sir Stephen's.) She asked him why, certain beforehand of the
reply. </P>
<P>&quot;Out of respect,&quot; Ren&eacute; replied. </P>
<P>&quot;But I belong to<I> you</I>,&quot; O had said. </P>
<P>&quot;You belong to Sir Stephen <I>first</I>.&quot; </P>
<P>And it was true, at least in the sense that when Ren&eacute; had surrendered
her to his friend the surrender had been absolute, that Sir Stephen's slightest
desired took precedence over Ren&eacute;'s decisions as far as she was
concerned, and even over her own. If Ren&eacute; had decided that they would
dine together and go to the theater, and Sir Stephen happened to phone an hour
before he was to pick up O, Ren&eacute; would come by for her at the studio as
agreed, but only to drive her to Sir Stephen's door and leave her there. Once,
and only once, O had asked Ren&eacute; to please ask Sir Stephen to change the
day, because she so much wanted to go with Ren&eacute; to a party to which they
were both invited. Ren&eacute; had refused. </P>
<P>&quot;My sweet angel,&quot; he had said, &quot;you mean you still haven't
understood that you no longer belong to me, that I'm not longer the master
who's in charge of you?&quot; </P>
<P>Not only had he refused, but he had told Sir Stephen of O's request and, in
her presence, asked him to punish her harshly enough so that she would never
again dare even to conceive of shirking her duties. </P>
<P>&quot;Certainly,&quot; Sir Stephen had replied. </P>
<P>The scene had taken place in the little oval room with the inlaid floor, in
which the only piece of furniture was a table encrusted with mother-of-pearl,
the room adjoining the yellow and gray living room. Ren&eacute; remained only
long enough to betray O and hear Sir Stephen's reply. Then he shook hands with
him, smiled at O, and left. Through the window, O saw him crossing the
courtyard; he did not turn around; she heard the car door slam shut, the roar
of the motor, and in a little mirror imbedded in the wall she caught a glimpse
of her own image: she was white with fear and despair. Then, mechanically, when
she walked past Sir Stephen, who opened the living-room door for her and stood
back for her to pass, she looked at him: he was as pale as she. In a flash, she
was absolutely certain that he loved her, but it was a fleeting certainty that
vanished as fast as it had come. Although she did not believe it and chided
herself for having thought of it, she was comforted by it and undressed meekly,
on a mere signal from him. Then, and for the first time since he had been
making her come two or three times a week, and using her slowly, sometimes
making her wait for an hour naked without coming near her, listening to her
entreaties without ever replying, for there were times when she did beg and
beseech, enjoining her to do the same things always at the same moments, as in
a ritual, so that she knew when her mouth was supposed to caress him and when,
on her knees, her head buried in the silken sofa, she should offer him only her
back, which he now possessed without hurting her, for the first time, for in
spite of the fear which convulsed her - or perhaps because of that fear - she
opened to him, in spite of the chagrin she felt at Ren&eacute;'s betrayal, but
perhaps too because of it, she surrendered herself completely. And for the
first time, so gentle were her yielding eyes when they fastened on Sir
Stephen's pale, burning gaze, that he suddenly spoke to her in French,
employing the familiar <I>tu</I> form: </P>
<P>&quot;I'm going to put a gag in your mouth, O, because I'd like to whip you
till I draw blood. Do I have your permission?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;I'm yours,&quot; O said. </P>
<P>She was standing in the middle of the drawing room, and her arms raised and
held together by the Roissy bracelets, which were attached by a chain to a ring
in the ceiling from which a chandelier had formerly hung, thrust her breasts
forward. Sir Stephen caressed them, then kissed them, then kissed her mouth
once, ten times. (He had never kissed her.) And when he had put on the gag,
which filled her mouth with the taste of wet canvas and pushed her tongue to
the back of her throat, the gag so arranged that she could scarcely clench it
in her teeth, he took her by the hair. Held in equilibrium by the chain, she
stumbled on her bare feet. </P>
<P>&quot;Excuse me, O,&quot; he murmured (he had never before begged her
pardon), then he let her go, and struck. </P>
<P>&nbsp; </P>
<P> </P>

</bLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="images/crop2.gif"> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <P>&nbsp; </P>
<P>When Ren&eacute; returned to O's apartment after midnight, after having gone
alone to the party they had intended to go to together, he found her in bed,
trembling in the white nylon of her long nightgown. Sir Stephen had brought her
home and put her to bed himself and kissed her again. She told Ren&eacute;
that. She also told him that she no longer had any inclination not to obey Sir
Stephen, realizing full well that from this Ren&eacute; would conclude that she
deemed it essential, and even pleasant to be beaten (which was true; but this
was not the only reason). What she was also certain of was that it was equally
essential to Ren&eacute; that she be beaten. He was as horrified at the idea of
striking her - so much so that he had never been able to bring himself to do it
- as he enjoyed seeing her struggle and hearing her scream. Once, in his
presence, Sir Stephen had used the riding crop on her. Ren&eacute; had forced O
back against the table and held her there, motionless. Her skirt had slipped
down; he had lifted it up. Perhaps he needed even more to know that while he
was not with her, while he was away walking or working, O was writing, moaning,
and crying beneath the whip, was asking for his pity and not obtaining it - and
was aware that this pain and humiliation had been inflicted on her by the will
of the lover whom she loved, and for his pleasure. At Roissy, he had had her
flogged by the valets. In Sir Stephen he had found the stern master he himself
was unable to be. The fact that the man he most admired in the world could take
a fancy to her and take the trouble to tame her, only made Ren&eacute;'s
passion all the greater, as O could plainly see. All the mouths that had probed
her mouth, all the hands that had seized her breasts and her belly, all the
members that had been thrust into her and so perfectly provided the living
proof that she was indeed prostituted, had at the same time provided the proof
that she was worthy of being prostituted and had, so to speak, sanctified her.
But this, in Ren&eacute;'s eyes, was nothing compared to the proof Sir Stephen
provided. Each time she emerged from his arms, Ren&eacute; looked for the mark
of a god upon her. O knew full well that if he had betrayed her a few hours
before, it was in order to provoke new, and crueler, marks. And she also knew
that, though the reasons for provoking them might disappear, Sir Stephen would
not turn back. So much the worse. (But to herself she was thinking the exact
opposite.) Ren&eacute; impressed and overwhelmed, gazed for a long time at the
thin body marked by thick, purple welts like so many ropes spanning the
shoulders, the back, the buttocks, the belly, and the breasts, welt which
sometimes overlapped and crisscrossed. Here and there a little blood still
oozed. </P>
<P>&quot;Oh, how I love you,&quot; he murmured. </P>
<P>With trembling hands he took off his clothes, turned out the light, and lay
down next to O. She moaned in the darkness, all the time he possessed her. </P>

<IMG SRC="images/crop2.gif"> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <P>&nbsp; </P>
<P>The welts on O's body took almost a month to disappear. In places where the
skin had been broken, she still bore the traces of slightly whiter lines, like
very old scars. If ever she were inclined to forget where they came from, the
attitude of Ren&eacute; and Sir Stephen were there to remind her. </P>
<P>Ren&eacute;, of course, had a key to O's apartment. He hadn't thought to
give one to Sir Stephen, probably because, till now, Sir Stephen had not
evinced the desire to visit O's place. But the fact that he had brought her
home that night suddenly made Ren&eacute; realize that this door, which only he
and O could open, might be considered by Sir Stephen as an obstacle, a barrier,
or as a restriction deliberately imposed by Ren&eacute;, and that it was
ridiculous to give him O if he did not at the same time give him the freedom to
come and go at O's whenever he pleased. In short, he had a key made, gave it to
Sir Stephen, and told O only after Sir Stephen had accepted it. She did not
dream of protesting, and she soon discovered that, while she was waiting for
Sir Stephen to appear, she felt incomprehensibly peaceful. She waited for a
long time, wondering whether he would surprise her by coming in the middle of
the night, whether he would take advantage of one of Ren&eacute;'s absences,
whether he would come alone, or indeed whether he would even come at all. She
did not dare speak about it to Ren&eacute;. </P>
<P>On morning when the cleaning woman had happened not to be there and O had
gotten up earlier than usual and, at ten o'clock, was already dressed and ready
to go out, she heard a key turning in the lock and flew to the door shouting:
&quot;Ren&eacute;&quot; (for there were times when Ren&eacute; did arrive in
this way and at this hour, and she had not dreamed it could be anyone but he).
It was Sir Stephen, who smiled and said to her: </P>
<P>&quot;All right, why don't we call up Ren&eacute;.&quot; </P>
<P>But Ren&eacute;, tied up at his office by a business appointment, would be
there only in an hour's time. </P>
<P>O, her heart pounding wildly (and she wondering why), watched Sir Stephen
hang up. He sat her down on the bed, took her head in both his hands, and
forced her mouth open slightly in order to kiss her. She was so out of breath
that she might have slipped and fallen if he had not held her. But he did hold
her, and straightened her up. </P>
<P>She could not understand why her throat was knotted by such a feeling of
anxiety and anguish, for, after all, what did she have to fear from Sir Stephen
that she had not already experienced. </P>
<P>He bade her remove all her clothes, and watched her, without saying a word,
as she obeyed. Wasn't she, in fact, quite accustomed to his silence, as she was
accustomed to waiting for him to decide what his pleasure would be? She had to
admit she had been deceiving herself, and that if she was taken aback by the
time and the place, by the fact that she had never been naked in this room for
anyone except Ren&eacute;, the basic reason for her being upset was actually
still the same: her own self-consciousness. The only difference was that this
self-consciousness was made all the more apparent to her because it was not
taking place in some specific spot to which she had to repair in order to
submit to it, and not at night, thereby partaking of a dream or of some
clandestine existence in relation to the length of the day, as Roissy had been
in relation to the length of her life with Ren&eacute;. The bright light of a
May day turned the clandestine into something public: henceforth the reality of
the night and the reality of day would be one and the same. Henceforth - and O
was thinking: at last. This is doubtless the source of that strange sentiment
of security, mingled with terror, to which she felt she was surrendering
herself and of which, without understand it, she had had a premonition.
Henceforth there were no more hiatuses, no dead time, no remission. He whom one
awaits is, because he is expected, already present, already present, already
master. Sir Stephen was a far more demanding but also a far surer master than
Ren&eacute;. And however passionately O loved Ren&eacute;, and he her, there
was between them a kind of equality (were it only the equality of age) which
eliminated in her any feeling of obedience, the awareness of her submission.
Whatever he wanted of her she wanted too, solely because he was asking it of
her. But it was as though he had instilled in her, insofar as Sir Stephen was
concerned, his own admiration, his own respect. She obeyed Sir Stephen's orders
as orders about which there was no question, and was grateful to him for having
give them to her. Whether he addressed her in French or English, employed the
familiar <I>tu</I> or the less personal <I>vous</I> form with her, she, like a
stranger or a servant, never addressed him as anything but Sir Stephen. She
told herself that the term &quot;Lord&quot; would have been more appropriate,
if she had dared utter it, as he, in referring to her, would have been better
advised to employ the word &quot;slave.&quot; She also told herself that all
was well, since Ren&eacute; was happy loving in her Sir Stephen's slave. </P>
<P>And so, her clothes neatly arranged at the foot of the bed, having again put
on her high-heeled mules, she waited, with lowered yes, facing Sir Stephen, who
was leaning against the window. Bright sunlight was streaming through the
dotted muslin curtains and gently warmed her hips and thighs. She was not
looking for any special effect, but it immediately occurred to her that she
should have put on more perfume, she realized that she had not made up the tips
of her breasts, and that, luckily, she had on her mules, for the nail polish on
her toenails was beginning to peel off. Then she suddenly knew that what she
was in fact waiting for in this silence, and this light, was for Sir Stephen to
make some signal to her, or for him to order her to kneel down before him,
unbutton him, and caress him. But no. Because she alone had been the one to
whom such a thought had occurred, she turned scarlet, and as she was blushing
she was thinking what a fool she was to blush: such modesty and shame in a
whore! </P>
<P>Just then, Sir Stephen asked O to sit down before her dressing table and
hear what he had to say. The dressing table was not, properly speaking, a
dressing table, but next to a low ledge set into the wall, on which were
arranged brushes and bottles, a large Restoration swing-mirror in which O,
seated in her low-slung chair, could see herself full length. </P>
<P>Sir Stephen paced back and forth behind her as he talked; from time to time
his reflection crossed the mirror, behind the image of O, but his was a
reflection which seemed far away, because the silvering of the mirror was
discolored and slightly murky. </P>
<P>O, her hands unclasped and her knees apart, had an urge to seize the
reflection and stop it, in order to reply more easily. For Sir Stephen,
speaking in a clipped English, was asking question after question, the last
questions O would ever have dreamed he would ask, even assuming he would ask
any in the first place. Hardly had he begin, however, when he broke off to
settle O deeper and farther back in the chair; with hr left leg over the arm of
the chair and the other curled up slightly, O, in that bath of bright light,
was then presented, to her own eyes and to Sir Stephen's as perfectly open as
though an invisible lover had withdrawn from her and left her slightly ajar. 
</P>
<P>Sir Stephen resumed his questioning, with a judge-like resolution and the
skill of a father confessor. O did not see him speaking, and saw herself
replying. Whether she had, since she had returned from Roissy, belonged to
other men besides Ren&eacute; and himself? No. Whether she had wanted to belong
to any other she might have met? No. Whether she caressed herself at night,
when she was alone? No. Whether she had any girl friends she caressed or who
she allowed to caress her? No (the &quot;no&quot; was more hesitant). Any
girlfriends she did desire? Well, there was Jacqueline, but &quot;friend&quot;
was stretching the term. Acquaintance would be closer, or even chum, the way
well-bred schoolgirls refer to each other in high-class boarding schools. </P>
<P>Whereupon Sir Stephen asked her whether she had any photographs of
Jacqueline, and he helped her to her feet so she could go and get them. It was
in the living room that Ren&eacute;, entering out of breath, for he had dashed
up the four flights of stairs, came upon them: O was standing in front of the
big table on which there shone, black and white, like puddles of water in the
night, all of the pictures of Jacqueline. Sir Stephen, half-seated on the
table, was taking them one by one as O handed them to him, and putting them
back on the table; his other hand was holding O's womb. From that moment on,
Sir Stephen, who had greeted Ren&eacute; without letting go of her - in fact
she felt his hand probe deeper into her - had ceased addressing her, and
addressed himself to Ren&eacute;. She thought she knew why: with Ren&eacute;
there, the accord between Sir Stephen and Ren&eacute; concerning her was
established, but apart from her, she was only the occasion for it or the object
of it, they no longer had to question her, nor she to reply; what she had to
do, and even what she had to be, was decided without her. </P>
<P>It was almost noon. The sun, falling directly on the table, curled the edges
of the photographs. O wanted to move them and flatten them out to keep them
from being ruined, but her fingers fumbled, she was on the verge of yielding to
the burning probe of Sir Stephen's hand and allowing a moan to escape from her
lips. She failed to hold it back, did in fact moan, and found herself sprawled
flat on her back among the photographs, where Sir Stephen had rudely shoved her
as he left her, with her legs spread and dangling. Her feet were not touching
the floor; one of her mules slipped from her foot and dropped noiselessly onto
the white rung. Her face was flooded with sunshine: she closed her eyes. </P>
<P>Later, much later, she must have remembered overhearing the conversation
between Sir Stephen and Ren&eacute;, but at the time she was not struck by it,
as though it did not concern her and, simultaneously, as though she had already
experienced it before. And it was true that she had already experienced a
similar scene, since the first time that Ren&eacute; had taken her to Sir
Stephen's, they had discussed her in the same way. But on that initial occasion
she had been a stranger to Sir Stephen, and Ren&eacute; had done most of the
talking. Since then, Sir Stephen had made her submit to all his fantasies, had
molded her to his own taste, had demanded and obtained from her, as something
quite routine, the most outrageous and scurrilous acts. She had nothing more to
give than hat he already possessed. At least so she thought. </P>
<P>He was speaking, he who generally was silent in her presence, and his
remarks, as well as Ren&eacute;'s revealed that they were renewing a
conversation they often engaged in together, with her as the subject. It was a
question of how she could best be utilized, and how the things each of them had
learned from his particular use of her could best be shared. Sir Stephen
readily admitted that O was infinitely more moving when her body was covered
with marks, of whatever kind, if only because these marks made it impossible
for her to cheat and immediately proclaimed, the moment they were seen, that
anything went as far as she was concerned. For to know this was one thing, but
to see the proof of it, and to see the proof constantly renewed, was quite
another. Ren&eacute;, Sir Stephen said, was perfectly right in wishing to have
her whipped. They decided that she would be, irrespective of the pleasure they
might derive from her screams and tears, as often as necessary so that some
trace of the flogging could always be seen upon her. </P>
<P>O, still lying motionless on her back, her loins still aflame, was
listening, and she had the feeling that by some strange substitution Sir
Stephen was speaking for her, in her place. As though he was somehow in her
body and could feel the anxiety, the anguish, and the shame, but also the
secret pride and harrowing pleasure that she was feeling, especially when she
was alone in a crowd of strangers, of passers-by in the street, or when she got
into a bus, or when she was at the studio with the models and technicians, and
she told herself that any and all of these people she was with, if they should
have an accident and have to be laid down on the ground or if a doctor had to
be called, would keep their secrets, even if they were unconscious and naked;
but not she: her secret did not depend upon her silence alone, did not depend
on her alone. Even if she wanted to, she could not indulge in the slightest
caprice - and that was indeed the meaning of one of Sir Stephen's questions -
without immediately revealing herself, she could not allow herself to partake
of the most innocent acts, such as playing tennis or swimming. That these
things were forbidden her was a comfort to her, a material comfort, as the bars
of the convent materially prevent the cloistered girls from belonging to one
another, and from escaping. For this reason too, how could she run the risk
that Jacqueline would not spurn her, without at the same time running the risk
of having to explain the truth to Jacqueline, or at least part of the truth? 
</P>
<P>The sun had moved and left her face. Her shoulders were sticking to the
glossy surface of the photographs on which she was lying, and against her knee
she could feel the rough edge of Sir Stephen's suitcoat, for he had come back
beside her. He and Ren&eacute; each took her by one hand and helped her to her
feet. Ren&eacute; picked up one of her mules. It was time for her to get
dressed. </P>
<P>It was during the lunch that followed, at Saint-Cloud on the banks of the
Seine, that Sir Stephen, who had remained alone with her, began to question her
once again. The restaurant tables, covered with white tablecloths, were
arranged on a shaded terrace which was bordered by privet hedges, at the foot
of which was a bed of dark red, scarcely opened peonies. </P>
<P>Even before Sir Stephen could make a sign to her, O had obediently lifted
her skirts as she sat down on the iron chair, and it had taken her bare thighs
a long time to warm the cold iron. They heard the water slapping against the
boats tied up to the wooden jetty at the end of the terrace. Sir Stephen was
seated across from her, and O was speaking slowly, determined not to say
anything that was not true. What Sir Stephen wanted to know was why she liked
Jacqueline. Oh! That was easy: it was because she was too beautiful for O, like
the full-sized dolls given to the poor children for Christmas, which they're
afraid to touch. And yet she knew that if she had not spoken to her, and had
not accosted her, it was because she really didn't want to. As she said this
she raised her eyes, which had been lowered, fixed on the bed of peonies, and
she realized that Sir Stephen was staring at her lips. Was he listening to what
she was saying, or was he merely listening to the sound of her voice or
watching the movement of her lips? Suddenly she stopped speaking, and Sir
Stephen's gaze rose and intercepted her own. What she read in it was so clear
this time, and it was so obvious to him that she had seen it, that now it was
his turn to blanch. If indeed he did love her, would he ever forgive her for
having noticed it? She could neither avert her gaze nor smile, nor speak. Had
her life depended on it, she would have been incapable of making a gesture,
incapable of fleeing, her legs would never have carried her. He would probably
never want anything from her save her submission to his desire, as long as he
continued to desire her. But was desire sufficient to explain the fact that,
from the day Ren&eacute; had handed her over to him, he asked for her and kept
her more and more frequently, sometimes merely to have her with him, without
asking anything from her? </P>
<P>There he sat across from her, silent and motionless. Some businessmen, at a
neighboring table, were talking as they drank a coffee so black and aromatic
that the aroma was wafted all the way to their own table. Two well-groomed,
contemptuous Americans lighted cigarettes halfway through their meal; the
gravel crunched beneath the waters' feet - one of them came over to refill Sir
Stephen's glass, which was three-quarters empty, but what was the point of
wasting good wine on a statue, a sleepwalker? The waiter did not belabor the
point. </P>
<P>O was delighted to feel that if his gray, ardent gaze wandered from her
eyes, it was to fasten on her breasts, her hands, before returning to her eyes.
Finally she saw the trace of a smile appear on his lips, a smile she dared to
answer. But utter a single word, impossible! She could barely breathe. </P>
<P>&quot;O...&quot; Sir Stephen said. </P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; O said, faintly. </P>
<P>&quot;O, what I'm going to speak to you about i have already discussed with
Ren&eacute;, and we're both in accord on it. But also, I...&quot; He broke off.
</P>
<P>O never knew whether it was because, seized by a sudden chill, she had
closed her eyes, or whether he too had difficulty catching his breath. He
paused, the water was changing plates, bringing O the menu so she could choose
the dessert. O handed it to Sir Stephen. A souffl&eacute;? Yes, a
souffl&eacute;. It will take twenty minutes. All right, twenty minutes. The
waiter left. </P>
<P>&quot;I need more than twenty minutes,&quot; Sir Stephen said. </P>
<P>And he went on in a steady voice, and what he said quickly convinced O that
one thing at least was certain, and that was, if he did love her, nothing would
be changed, unless one considered this curious respect a change, this ardor
with which he was saying to her: &quot;I'd be most pleased if you would care
to...&quot; instead of simply asking her to accede to his requests. Yet they
were still orders, and there was no question of O's not obeying them. She
pointed this out to Sir Stephen. He admitted as much. </P>
<P>&quot;I still want your answer,&quot; he said. </P>
<P>&quot;I'll do whatever you like,&quot; O responded, and the echo of what she
was saying resounded in her memory: &quot;I'll do whatever you like,&quot; she
was used to saying to Ren&eacute;. Almost in a whisper, she murmured:
&quot;Ren&eacute;...&quot; </P>
<P>Sir Stephen heard it. </P>
<P>&quot;Ren&eacute; knows what I want from you. Listen to me.&quot; </P>
<P>He was speaking English, but in a low, carefully controlled voice which was
inaudible at the neighboring tables. Whenever the waiters approached their
table, he fell silent, resuming his sentence where he had left off as soon as
they had moved away. What he was saying seemed strange and out of keeping with
this peaceful, public place, and yet what was strangest of all was that he
could say it, and O hear it, so naturally. </P>
<P>He began by reminding her that the first evening when she had come to his
apartment he had given her an order she had refused to obey, and he noted that
although he might have slapped her then, he had never repeated the order since
that night. Would she grant him now what she had refused him then? O understood
that not only must she acquiesce, but that he wanted to hear her say it
herself, in her own words, say that she would caress herself any time he asked
her to. She said it, and again she saw the yellow and gray drawing room,
Ren&eacute;'s departure from it, her revulsion that first evening, the fire
glowing between her open knees when she was lying naked on the rug. Tonight, in
this same drawing room... No, Sir Stephen had not specified, and was going on. 
</P>
<P>He also pointed out to her that she had never been possessed in his presence
by Ren&eacute; (or by anyone else), as she had been by him in Ren&eacute;'s
presence (and at Roissy by a whole host of others). From this she should not
conclude that Ren&eacute; would be the only one to humiliate her by handing her
over to a man who did not lover her - and perhaps derive pleasure from it - in
the presence of a man who did. (He went on at such length, and with such
cruelty - she soon would open her thighs and back, and her mouth, to those of
his friends who, once they had met her, might desire her - that O suspected
that this coarseness was aimed as much at himself as it was at her, and the
only thing she remembered was the end of the sentence: in the presence of a man
who did love her. What more did she want in the way of a confession?) What was
more, he would bring her back to Roissy sometime in the course of the summer.
Hadn't it ever struck her as surprising, this isolation in which first then,
then he had kept her? They were the only men she saw, either together, or one
after the other. Whenever Sir Stephen had invited people to his apartment on
the rue de Poitiers, O was never invited. She had never lunched or dined at his
place. Nor had Ren&eacute; ever introduced her to any of his friends, except
for Sir Stephen. In all probability he would continue to keep her in the
background, for to Sir Stephen was henceforth reserved the privilege of doing
as he liked with her. But she should not get the idea that she belonged to him
that she would be detained more legally; on the contrary. (But what hurt and
wounded O most was the realization that Sir Stephen was going to treat her in
exactly the same way Ren&eacute; had, in the same, identical way.) The iron and
gold ring that she was wearing on her left hand - and did she recall that the
ring had been chosen so tight-fitting that they had had to force it on her ring
finger? She could not take it off - that ring was the sign that she was a
slave, but one who was common property. It had been merely by chance that,
since this past autumn, she had not met any Roissy members who might have
noticed her irons, or revealed that they had noticed them. </P>
<P>The word irons, used in the plural, which she had taken to be an equivocal
term when Sir Stephen had told her that irons were becoming to her, had in no
wise been equivocal; it had been a mode of recognition, a password. Sir Stephen
had not had to use the second formula: namely, whose irons was she wearing? But
if today this question were asked of O, what would she reply? O hesitated? </P>
<P>&quot;Ren&eacute;'s and yours,&quot; she said. </P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; Sir Stephen said, &quot;mine. Ren&eacute; wants you to be
answerable first of all to me.&quot; </P>
<P>O was fully cognizant of this, why did she pretend she was not? In a short
while, and in any case prior to her return to Roissy, she would have to accept
a definitive mar, which would not absolve her from the obligation of being a
common-property slave, Sir Stephen's and the traces of the floggings on her
body, or the marks raised by the riding crop, if indeed they were inflicted
again, would be discreet and futile compared to this ultimate mark. (But what
would the mark be, of what would it consist, in what way would it be
definitive? O, terrified and fascinated, was dying to know, she had to know
immediately. But it was obvious that Sir Stephen was not yet ready to explain
it. And it was true that she had to accept, to consent in the real sense of the
term, for nothing would be inflicted upon her by force to which she had not
already previously consented; she could refuse, nothing was keeping her
enslaved except her love and her self-enslavement. What prevented her from
leaving?) And yet, before this mark was imposed upon her, even before Sir
Stephen became accustomed to flogging her, as had been decided by Ren&eacute;
and himself, to flogging her in such a way that the traces were constantly
visible, she would be granted a reprieve - the time required for her to make
Jacqueline submit to her. Stunned, O raised her head and looked at Sir Stephen.
Why? Why Jacqueline? And if Jacqueline interested Sir Stephen, why was it in
relation to O? </P>
<P>&quot;There are two reasons,&quot; Sir Stephen said. &quot;The first, and
least important, is that I would like to see you kiss and caress a woman.&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;But even assuming she gives in to me,&quot; cried O, &quot;how in the
world do you expect me to make her consent to your being present?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;That's the least of my worries,&quot; Sir Stephen said. &quot;If
necessary, by betrayal, and anyway, I'm counting on you for a great deal more
than that, for the second reason why I want you to seduce her is that you're to
be the bait that lures her to Roissy.&quot; </P>
<P>O set down the cup of coffee she was holding in her hand, shaking so
violently that she spilled the viscous dregs of coffee and sugar at the bottom
of the cup. Like a soothsayer, she saw unbearable images in the spreading brown
stain on the tablecloth: Jacqueline's glazed eyes confronting the valet Pierre;
her flanks, doubtless as golden as her breasts, though O had never seen them,
exposed to view below the folds of her long red velvet dress with its tucked-up
skirt; her downy cheeks stained with tears and her painted mouth open and
screaming, and her straight hair, in a Dutch bob along her forehead, straight
as new-mown hay - no, it was impossible, not her, not Jacqueline. </P>
<P>&quot;No, it's out of the question,&quot; she said. </P>
<P>&quot;Of course it's not,&quot; Sir Stephen retorted. &quot;How do you think
girls are recruited for Roissy? Once you have brought her there, the matter
will be completely out of your hands, and anyway, if she wants to leave, she
can leave. Come along now.&quot; </P>
<P>He had gotten suddenly to his feet, leaving the money for the bill on the
table. O followed him to the car, climbed in, and sat down. Scarcely had they
entered the Bois de Boulogne when he turned in to a side road, stopped the car
in a narrow lane, and took her in his arms. </P>
