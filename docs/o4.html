<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <BR>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">What O failed completely to understand now was why she had
ever been hesitant to speak to Jacqueline about what Ren&eacute; rightly called
her true condition. Anne-Marie had warned her that she would be changed when
she left Samois, but O had never imagined that the change would be so great.
With Jacqueline back, more lovely and radiant than ever, it seemed natural to
her to be no more reticent about revealing herself when she bathed or dressed
than she was when she was alone. And yet Jacqueline was so disinterested in
others, in anything that did not pertain directly to herself, that it was not
until the second day after Jacqueline arrived back and by chance came into the
bathroom just as O was stepping out of the tub, that O jingled her irons
against the porcelain to draw her attention to the odd noise. Jacqueline turned
her head, and saw both the disks hanging between her legs and the black stripes
crisscrossing her thighs and breasts. </FONT></P>
<P>&quot;What in the world's the matter?&quot; she said. </P>
<P>&quot;It's Sir Stephen,&quot; O replied. And she added, as thought it were
something to be taken completely for granted: &quot;Ren&eacute; gave me to him,
and he's had me pierced with his rings. Look.&quot; And as she dried herself
with the bath towel she came over to Jacqueline, who was so staggered she had
slumped onto the lacquered bathroom stool, close enough so that Jacqueline
could take the disk in her hand and read the inscription; then, slipping down
her bathrobe she turned around and pointed to the initials <I>S</I> and
<I>H</I> engraved in her buttocks and said: </P>
<P>&quot;He also had me branded with his monogram. As for the rest, that's
where I was flogged with a riding crop. He generally whips me himself, but he
also has a Negro maid whip me.&quot; </P>
<P>Dumbfounded, Jacqueline gazed at O. O burst out laughing and made as though
to kiss her. Terror-stricken, Jacqueline pushed her away and fled into her own
room. O leisurely finished drying herself, put on her perfume, and combed her
hair. She put on her corset, her stockings, her mules, and when she opened the
bathroom door she encountered Jacqueline's gaze in the mirror, before which she
was combing her hair, without having the vaguest notion what she was doing. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Lace up my corset, will you?&quot; she said. &quot;You really do look
astonished. Ren&eacute;'s in love with you, did he say anything about it?&quot;
</P>
<P>&quot;I don't understand,&quot; Jacqueline said. And she lost no time
revealing what surprised her the most. &quot;You look as though you were proud
of it, I don't understand.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;You will, after Ren&eacute; takes you to Roissy. By the way, have you
already slept with him?&quot; </P>
<P>Jacqueline's face turned a bright crimson, and she was shaking her head in
denial with such little conviction that once again O burst out laughing. </P>
<P>&quot;You're lying, darling. Don't be an ass. You have every right in the
world to sleep with him. And I might add that that's no reason to reject me.
Come, let me caress you and I'll tell you all about Roissy.&quot; </P>
<P>Had Jacqueline been afraid that O's jealousy would explode in her face and
then yield to her out of relief when it did not, or was it curiosity, did she
want to hear the promised explanations, or was it merely because she loved the
patience, the slowness, the passion of O's caresses? In any event, yield she
did. </P>
<P>&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; she later said to O. </P>
<P>&quot;All right,&quot; O said. &quot;But first kiss the tips of my breasts.
It's time you got used to it, if you're ever to be of any use to
Ren&eacute;.&quot; </P>
<P>Jacqueline did as she was bade, so well in fact that she wrested a moan from
O. </P>
<P>&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; she said. </P>
<P>O's tale, however faithful and clear it may have been, and notwithstanding
the material proof she herself constituted, seemed completely mad to
Jacqueline. </P>
<P>&quot;You mean you're going back in September?&quot; she said. </P>
<P>&quot;After we've come back from the Midi,&quot; O said. &quot;I'll take
you, or Ren&eacute; will.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;To see what it's like, I wouldn't mind that,&quot; Jacqueline went on,
&quot;but only to see what it's like.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;I'm sure that can be arranged,&quot; said O, though she was convinced
of the contrary. But, she kept telling herself, if she could only persuade
Jacqueline to enter the gates at Roissy, Sir Stephen would be grateful to her -
and once she was in, there would be enough valets, chains, and whips to teach
Jacqueline to obey. </P>
<P>She already knew that the summer house that Sir Stephen had rented near
Cannes on the Riviera, where she was scheduled to spend the month of August
with Ren&eacute;, Jacqueline, and him (and with Jacqueline's younger sister,
whom Jacqueline had asked if she could bring along, not because she cared
especially to have her but because her mother had been hounding her to obtain
O's permission), she knew that her room, to which she was certain she could
entice Jacqueline, who would be unable to refuse when Ren&eacute; was away, was
separated from Sir Stephen's bedroom by a wall that looked as though it was
full but actually was not; the wall was decorated with a trompe l'oeil
latticework which enabled Sir Stephen to raise a blind on his die and thus to
see and hear as well as if he had been standing beside the bed. Jacqueline
would be surrendering to Sir Stephen's gaze while O was caressing her, and by
the time she found out it would be too late. O was pleased to think that she
could deliver Jacqueline by an act of betrayal, because she had felt insulted
at seeing Jacqueline's contempt for her condition as a flogged and branded
slave, a condition of which O herself was proud. </P>

<IMG SRC="images/crop2.gif"> <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> <P>&nbsp; </P>
<P>O had never been to the south of France before. The clear blue sky, the
almost mirror-like sea, the motionless pines beneath the burning sun:
everything seemed mineral and hostile to her. &quot;No real trees,&quot; she
remarked sadly to herself as she gazed at the fragrant thickets full of shrubs
and bushes, where all the tones, and even the lichens, were warm to the touch.
&quot;The sea doesn't even smell like the sea,&quot; she thought. She blamed
the sea for washing up nothing more than an occasional piece of wretched
seaweed which looked like dung, she blamed it for being too blue and for always
lapping at the same bit of shore. But in the garden of Sir Stephen's villa,
which was an old farmhouse that had been restored, they were far from the sea.
To left and right, high walls protected them from the neighbors; the servants'
wing faced the entrance courtyard, while the side of the house overlooking the
garden faced the east; O's bedroom was on this side, and opened directly onto a
second story terrace. The tops of the tall black cypress trees were level with
the overlapping hollow tiles which served as a parapet for the terrace, which
was protected from the noon sun by a reed latticework. The floor of the terrace
was of red tile, the same as the tiles in her bedroom. Aside from the wall
which separated O's bedroom from Sir Stephen's - and this was the wall of a
large alcove bounded by an archway and separated from the rest of the room by a
kind of railing similar to the railings of stairways, with banisters of
hand-carved wood - all the other walls were whitewashed. The thick white run on
the tile floor was made of cotton, the curtains were of yellow-and-white linen.
There were two armchairs upholstered in the same material, and some
triple-layered Oriental cushions. The only furniture was a heavy and very
handsome Regency bureau made of walnut, and a very long, narrow peasant table
in light-colored wood which was waxed till it shone like a mirror. O hung her
clothes in a closet. </P>
<P>Jacqueline's little sister Natalie had been given a room near O's, and in
the morning when she knew that O was taking a sunbath on the terrace, she came
out and lay down beside her. She had snow-white skin, was a shade plump, but
her features were none the less delicate and like her sister, she had slanting
eyes, but hers were black and shining, which made her look Chinese. Her black
hair was cut in straight bangs across her forehead, just above her eyebrows,
and in the back was also cut straight, at the nape of the neck. She had firm,
tremulous little breasts, and her adolescent hips were only beginning to fill
out. She too had chanced upon O, and had taken her quite by surprise, one day
when she had dashed out onto the terrace expecting to find her sister but found
O instead, lying there alone on her stomach on the Oriental pillows. But what
had shocked Jacqueline filled Natalie with envy and desire. She asked her
sister about it. Jacqueline's replies, which were intended to shock and revolt
young Natalie by repeating to her what O had related, in no wise altered
Natalie's feelings. If anything, it accomplished the contrary. She had fallen
in love with O. For more than a week she managed to keep it to herself, then
late one Sunday afternoon she managed to be alone with O. </P>
<P>The weather had been cooler than normal. Ren&eacute;, who had spent part of
the morning swimming, was asleep on the sofa of a cool room on the ground
floor. Nettled at seeing that he should prefer to take a nap, Jacqueline had
gone upstairs and joined O in her alcove. The sea and sun had already made her
more golden than before: her hair, her eyebrows, her eyelashes, her nether
fleece, her armpits, all seemed to be powdered with silver, and since she was
not wearing any make-up, her mouth was the same color pink as the pink flesh
between her thighs. </P>
<P>To make sure that Sir Stephen could see Jacqueline in detail - and O thought
to herself that if she were Jacqueline she would have guessed, or noticed, his
invisible presence - O took pains to pull back her legs and keep them spread in
the light of the bedside lamp which she had turned on. The shutters were
closed, the room almost dark, despite the thin rays of light that spilled in
where the wood was not snug. For more than an hour Jacqueline moaned to O's
caressed, and finally, her breasts aroused, her arms thrown back behind her
head while her hands circled the wooden bars of the headboard of O's
Italian-style bed, she began to cry out when O, parting the lobes hemmed with
pale hair, slowly began to bite the crest of flesh at the point between her
thighs where the dainty, supple lips joined. O felt her rigid and burning
beneath her tongue, and wrested cry after cry from her lips, with no respite,
until she suddenly relaxed, the springs broken, and she lay there moist with
pleasure. Then O sent her back to her room, where she fell asleep. </P>
<P>Jacqueline was awake and ready, though, when Ren&eacute; came for her at
five o'clock to go sailing, with Natalie, in a small sailboat, as they had
grown accustomed to doing. A slight wind usually came up at the end of the
afternoon. </P>
<P>&quot;Where's Natalie?&quot; Ren&eacute; said. </P>
<P>Natalie was not in her room, nor was she anywhere in the house. They went
out to the garden and called her. Ren&eacute; went as far as the thicket of
scrub oak at the end of the garden; no one answered. </P>
<P>&quot;Maybe she's already down at the inlet,&quot; Ren&eacute; said,
&quot;or in the boat.&quot; </P>
<P>They left without calling her any more. </P>
<P>It was at that point that O, who was lying on the Oriental pillows on her
terrace, glanced through the tile banisters, and saw Natalie running toward the
house. She got up, put on her dressing gown - it was still so warm, even this
late in the afternoon, that she was naked - and was tying her belt when Natalie
erupted into the room like one of the Furies and threw herself at O. </P>
<P>&quot;She's gone,&quot; she shouted, &quot;she's finally gone. I heard her,
O, I heard you both, I was listening behind the door. You kiss her, you caress
her. Why don't you caress me, why don't you kiss me? Is it because I'm dark,
because I'm not pretty? She doesn't love you, O, but I do, I love you!&quot;
And she broke down and began to sob. </P>
<P>&quot;All right, fine,&quot; O said to herself. </P>
<P>She eased the child into an armchair, took a large handkerchief from her
bureau (it was one of Sir Stephen's), and when Natalie's sobs had subsided a
little, wiped away her tears away. Natalie begged her forgiveness, kissing O's
hands. </P>
<P>&quot;Even if you don't want to kiss me, O, keep me with you. Keep me with
you always. If you had a dog, you'd keep him and take care of him. And even if
you don't want to kiss me, but would enjoy beating me, you can beat me. But
don't send me away.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Keep still, Natalie, you don't know what you're saying,&quot; O
murmured, almost in a whisper. </P>
<P>The child, slipping down and hugging O's knees, also replied in a
near-whisper: </P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yes I do. I saw you the other morning on the terrace. I saw the
initials, I saw the long black-and-blue marks. And Jacqueline has told
me...&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Told you what?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Where you've been, O, and what they did to you there.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Did she talk to you about Roissy?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;She also told me that you had been, that you are...&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;That I was what?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;That you wear iron rings.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;That's right,&quot; O said, &quot;and what else?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;That Sir Stephen whips you every day.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;That's correct,&quot; O repeated, &quot;and he'll be here any second.
So run along, Natalie.&quot; </P>
<P>Natalie, without shifting position, raised her head to O, and O's eyes
encountered her adoring gaze. </P>
<P>&quot;Teach me, O, please teach me,&quot; she started in again, &quot;I want
to be like you. I'll do anything you tell me. Promise me you'll take me with
you when you go back to that place Jacqueline told me about.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;You're too young,&quot; O said. </P>
<P>&quot;No, I'm not too young, I'm fifteen going on sixteen,&quot; she cried
out angrily. &quot;I'm not too young. Ask Sir Stephen,&quot; she said, for he
had just entered the room. </P>
<P>Natalie was granted permission to remain with O, and extracted the promise
that she would be taken to Roissy. But Sir Stephen forbade O to teach her the
least caress, not even a kiss on the lips, and also gave strict instructions
that O was not to allow Natalie to kiss her. He had every intention of having
her reach Roissy completely untouched by hands or lips. By way of compensation,
what he did demand, since Natalie was loath to leave O, was that she not leave
her a single moment, that she witness O caressing both Jacqueline and himself,
that she be present when O yielded to him and when he whipped her, or when she
was flogged by old Norah. The kisses with which O smothered her sister, O's
mouth glued to her, made Natalie quiver with jealousy and hate. But glowering
on the carpet in the alcove, at the foot of O's bed, like little Dinarzade at
the foot of Scheherazade's bed, she watched each time that O, tied to the
wooden balustrade, writhed and squirmed beneath the riding crop, saw O on her
knees humbling receiving Sir Stephen's massive upright sex in her mouth, saw
her, prostate, spread her own buttocks with both hands to offer him the after
passage - she witnessed all these things with no other feelings but those of
admiration, envy, and impatience. </P>
<P>It was about this same time that a change took place in Jacqueline: perhaps
O had counted too heavily both on Jacqueline's indifference and her sensuality,
perhaps Jacqueline herself naively felt that surrendering herself to O was
dangerous for her relations with Ren&eacute;: but whatever the reason, she
suddenly ceased coming to O. At the same time, she seemed to be keeping herself
aloof from Ren&eacute;, with whom, whoever, she was spending almost every day
and every night. She had never acted as though she were in love with him. She
studied him coldly, and when she smiled at him, her eyes remained cold. Even
assuming that she was as completely abandoned with him as she was with O, which
was quite likely, O could not help thinking that this surrender was
superficial. Whereas Ren&eacute; was head over heels in love with her,
paralyzed by a love such as he had never known before, a worrisome, uncertain
love, one he was far from sure was requited, a love that acts not, for fear of
offending. He lived, he slept in the same house as Sir Stephen, the same house
as O, he lunched, he dined, he went on walks with Sir Stephen, with O, he
conversed with them both: he didn't see them, he didn't hear what they said. He
saw, he heard, he talked through them, beyond them, and as in a dream when one
tried to catch a departing train or clings desperately to the parapet of a
collapsing bridge, he was forever trying to understand the <I>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</I>, the truth which must have been lurking somewhere inside
Jacqueline, under that golden skin, like the mechanism inside a crying doll. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; thought O, &quot;the day I was so afraid would arrive is
here, the day when I'd merely be a shadow in Ren&eacute;'s past. And I'm not
even sad; the only thing I feel for him is pity, and even knowing he doesn't
desire me any longer, I can see him every day without any trace of bitterness,
without the least regret, without even feeling hurt. And yet only a few weeks
ago, I dashed all the way across town to his office, to beg him to tell me he
still loved me. Was that all my love was, all it meant? So light, so easily
gone and forgotten? Is solace that simple? And solace is not even the right
word: I'm happy. Do you mean to say it was enough for him to have given me to
Sir Stephen for me to be detached from him, for me to find a new love so easily
in the arms of another?&quot; </P>
<P>But then, what was Ren&eacute; compared to Sir Stephen? Ropes of straw,
anchors of cork, paper chains: these were the real symbols of the bonds with
which he had held her, and which he had been so quick to sever. But what a
delight and comfort, this iron ring which pierces the flesh and weighs one down
forever, this mark eternal, how peaceful and reassuring the hand of a master
who lays you on a bed of rock, the love of a master who knows how to take what
he loves ruthlessly, without pity. And O said to herself that, in the final
analysis, with Ren&eacute; she had been an apprentice to love, she had loved
him only to learn how to give herself, enslaved and surfeited, to Sir Stephen.
But to see Ren&eacute;, who had been so free with her - and she had loved his
free ways - walking as though he were hobbled, like someone whose legs were
ensnarled in the water and reeds of a pond whose surface seems calm but which,
deeper down, swirls with subterranean currents, to see him thus, filled O with
hate for Jacqueline. Did Ren&eacute; dimly perceive her feelings? Did O
carelessly reveal how she felt? In any case, O committed an error. </P>
<P>One afternoon she and Jacqueline had gone to Cannes together to the
hairdresser, alone, then to the Reserve Caf&eacute; for an ice cream on the
terrace. Jacqueline was superb in her tight-fitting black slacks and sheer
black sweater, eclipsing even the brilliance of the children around her she was
so bronzed and sleek, so hard and bright in the burning sun, so insolent and
inaccessible. She told O she had made an appointment there with the director
whose picture she had been playing in in Paris, to arrange for taking some
exteriors, probably in the mountains above Saint-Paul-de-Vence. And there he
was, forthright and determined. He didn't need to open his mouth, it was
obvious he was in love with Jacqueline. All one had to do was see the way he
looked at her. What was so surprising about that? Nothing; but what was
surprising was Jacqueline. Half reclining in one of those adjustable beach
chairs, Jacqueline listened to him as he talked of dates to be set,
appointments to be made, of the problems of raising enough money to finish the
half-completed picture. He used the <I>tu</I> form in addressing Jacqueline,
who replied with a mere nod or shake of her head, keeping her eyes half-closed.
O was seated across from Jacqueline, with him between them. It took no great
act of perception to notice that Jacqueline, whose eyes were lowered, was
watching, from beneath the protection of those motionless eyelids, the young
man's desire, the way she always did when she thought no one was looking. But
strangest of all was how upset she seemed, her hands quiet at her side, her
face serious and expressionless, without the trace of a smile, something she
had never displayed in Ren&eacute;'s presence. A fleeting, almost imperceptible
smile on her lips as O leaned forward to set her glass of ice water on the
table and their eyes met, was all O needed to realize that Jacqueline was aware
that O knew the game was up. It didn't bother her, though; it was rather O who
blushed. </P>
<P>&quot;Are you too warm?&quot; Jacqueline said. &quot;We'll be leaving in
five minutes. Red is becoming to you, by the way.&quot; </P>
<P>Then she smiled again, turning her gaze to her interlocutor, a smile so
utterly tender that it seemed impossible he would not hasten to embrace her.
But he did not. He was too young to know that motionlessness and silence can be
the lair of immodesty. He allowed Jacqueline to get up, shook hands with her,
and said goodbye. She would phone him. He also said goodbye to the shadow that
O represented for him, and stood on the sidewalk watching the black Buick
disappear down the avenue between the sun-drenched houses and the dark, almost
purple sea. The palm trees looked as though they had been cut out of metal, the
strollers like poorly fashioned wax models, animated by some absurd mechanism. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You really like him all that much?&quot; O said to Jacqueline as the
car left the city and moved along the upper coast road. </P>
<P>&quot;Is that any business of yours?&quot; Jacqueline responded. </P>
<P>&quot;It's Ren&eacute;'s business,&quot; she retorted. </P>
<P>&quot;What is Ren&eacute;'s business, and Sir Stephen's, and, if I
understand it correctly, a number of other people's, is the fact that you're
badly seated. You're going to wrinkle your dress.&quot; </P>
<P>O failed to move. </P>
<P>&quot;And I also thought,&quot; Jacqueline added, &quot;that you weren't
supposed to cross your legs.&quot; </P>
<P>But O was no longer listening. What did she care about Jacqueline's threats.
If Jacqueline threatened to inform on her for that peccadillo, what did she
think would keep her from denouncing Jacqueline in turn to Ren&eacute;? Not
that O lacked the desire to. But Ren&eacute; would not be able to bear the news
that Jacqueline was lying to him, or that she had plans of her own which did
not include him. How could she make Jacqueline believe that if she were to keep
still, it would be to avoid seeing Ren&eacute; lose face, turning pale over
someone other than herself, and perhaps revealing himself to be too weak to
punish her? How could she convince her that her silence, even more, would be
the result of her fear at seeing Ren&eacute;'s wrath turned against her, the
bearer of ill tidings, the informer? How could she tell Jacqueline that she
would not say a word, without giving the impression that she was making a
mutual non-betrayal pact with her? For Jacqueline had the idea that O was
terrified, terrified to death at what would happen to her if she, Jacqueline,
talked. </P>
<P>From that point on, until they got out of the car in the courtyard of the
old farm, they did not exchange another word. Without glancing at O, Jacqueline
picked a white geranium growing beside the house. O was following closely
enough behind to catch a whiff of the strong, delicate odor of the leaf
crumpled between her hands. Did she believe she would thus be able to mask the
odor of her own sweat, which was marking darkening circles beneath the arms of
her sweater and causing the black material to cling to her armpits. </P>
<P>In the big whitewashed room with the red-tile floor, Ren&eacute; was alone. 
</P>
<P>&quot;You're late,&quot; he said when they came in. &quot;Sir Stephen's
waiting for you in the next room,&quot; he added, nodding to O. &quot;He needs
you for something. He's not in a very good mood.&quot; </P>
<P>Jacqueline burst out laughing, and O looked at her and turned red. </P>
<P>&quot;You could have saved it for another time,&quot; said Ren&eacute;, who
misinterpreted both Jacqueline's laugh and O's concern. </P>
<P>&quot;That's not the reason,&quot; Jacqueline said, &quot;but I might say,
Ren&eacute;, your obedient beauty isn't so obedient when you're not around.
Look at her dress, you see how wrinkled it is?&quot; </P>
<P>O was standing in the middle of the room, facing Ren&eacute;. He told her to
turn around; she was rooted to the spot. </P>
<P>&quot;She also crosses her legs,&quot; Jacqueline added, &quot;but that you
won't be able to see, of course. As you won't be able to see the way she
accosts the boys.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;That's not true,&quot; O shouted, &quot;you're the one!&quot; and she
leaped at Jacqueline. </P>
<P>Ren&eacute; grabbed her just as she was about to hit Jacqueline, and she
went on struggling in his arms merely for the sake of feeling weaker than he,
of being at his mercy, when, lifting her head, she saw Sir Stephen standing in
the doorway looking at her. </P>
<P>Jacqueline had thrown herself down on the sofa, her tiny face hardened with
anger and fear, and O could feel that Ren&eacute;, though he had his hands full
trying to subdue her, had eyes only for Jacqueline. She ceased resisting and
crestfallen at the idea of having been found wanting in the presence of Sir
Stephen, she repeated, this time almost in a whisper: </P>
<P>&quot;It's not true, I swear it's not true.&quot; </P>
<P>Without uttering a word, without so much as a glance at Jacqueline, Sir
Stephen made a sign to Ren&eacute; to let O go, and to O to go into the other
room. But on the other side of the door O, who was immediately wedged against
the wall, her belly and breasts seized, her lips forced apart by Sir Stephen's
insistent tongue, moaned with happiness and deliverance. The points of her
breasts stiffened beneath his hand's caress, and with his other hand Sir
Stephen probed her loins so roughly she thought she would faint. Would she ever
dare to tell him that no pleasure, no joy, no figment of her imagination could
ever compete with the happiness she felt at the way he used her with such utter
freedom, at the notion that he could do anything with her, that there was no
limit, no restriction in the manner with which, on her body, he might search
for pleasure. Her absolute certainty that when he touched her, whether it was
to fondle or flog her, when he ordered her to do something it was solely
because he wanted to, her certainty that all he cared about was his own desire,
so overwhelmed and gratified O that each time she saw new proof of it, and
often even when it merely occurred to her in thought, a cape of fire, a burning
breastplate extending from the shoulders to the knees, descended upon her. As
she was there, pinned against the wall, her eyes closed, her lips murmuring
&quot;I love you&quot; when she could find the breath to say them, Sir
Stephen's hands, though they were as cool as the waters of a bubbling spring on
the fire coursing through her from head to toe, made her burn even hotter.
Gently he released her, dropping her skirt down over her moist thighs, closing
her bolero over her quivering breasts. </P>
<P>&quot;Come, O,&quot; he said, &quot;I need you.&quot; </P>
<P>Then, opening her eyes, O noticed that they were not alone. The big, bare,
whitewashed room, identical in all respects to the living room, also opened,
through a French door, onto the garden. Seated in a wicker chair on the
terrace, which lay between the house and garden, an enormous man, a giant of a
creature with a cigarette between his lips, his head shaved and his vast belly
swelling beneath his open shirt and cloth trousers, was gazing at O. He rose
and moved toward Sir Stephen, who was shoving O ahead of him. It was then that
O noticed, dangling at the end of his watch chain, the Roissy insignia that the
man was sporting. Still, Sir Stephen politely introduced him to O, simply as
&quot;Commander,&quot; with no name attached, and much to O's surprise she saw
that he was kissing her hand, the first time it had happened since she had been
involved with Roissy members (with the exception of Sir Stephen). </P>
<P>All three of them came back into the room, leaving the door open. Sir
Stephen walked over to one end of the fireplace and rang. On the Chinese table
beside the sofa, O saw a bottle of whisky, some soda water, and glasses. So he
was not ringing for something to drink. At the same time she noticed a large
cardboard box on the floor beside the fireplace. The man from Roissy had sat
down on a wicker chair, Sir Stephen was half-seated on the edge of the round
table, with one leg dangling. O, who had been motioned over to the sofa, had
meekly raised her skirt and could feel the prickly cotton of the roughly woven
Proven&ccedil;al upholstery. </P>
<P>It was Norah who came in. Sir Stephen ordered her to undress O and remove
her clothing from the room. O allowed her to take off her bolero, her dress,
her whalebone belt which constricted her waist, and her sandals. As soon as she
had stripped O completely, Norah left, and O, automatically reverting to the
rules of Roissy, and certain that all Sir Stephen waned from her was perfect
submissiveness, remained standing in the middle of the room, her eyes lowered,
so that she sensed rather than saw Natalie slip in through the open window,
dressed in black like her sister, barefoot and silent. Sir Stephen had
doubtless explained who she was and why she was there; to his visitor he merely
mentioned her name, to which the visitor did not respond, and asked her to make
them a drink. As soon as she had handed them some whisky, soda, water, and the
ice cubes (and, in the silence, the clink of the ice cubes against the side of
the glass made a harrowing racket), the Commander got up from his wicker chair,
in which he had been sitting while O was being undressed and, with his glass in
his hand, walked over to O. O thought that, with his free hand, he was going to
take her breast or seize her belly. But he did not touch her, confining himself
to scrutinizing her closely, from her parted lips to her parted knees. He
circled her, studying her breasts, her thighs, her hindquarters, inspecting her
in detail but offering no comment, and this careful scrutiny and the presence
of this gigantic body so close to her overwhelmed O so that she wasn't sure
whether she wanted to run away or, on the contrary, have him throw her down and
crush her. So upset was she that she lost control and raised her eyes toward
Sir Stephen, searching for help. He understood, smiled, came over to her, and
talking both her hands, pulled them behind her back, and held them in one of
his. She leaned back against him, her eyes closed, and it was in a dream, or at
least in the dusk of a near-sleep born of exhaustion, the way she had heard as
a child, still half under the influence of ether, the nurses talking about her,
thinking she was still asleep, of her hair, her pallor, her flat belly where
only the faint early signs of pubescence were showing, it was in a dream that
she heard the stranger complimenting Sir Stephen on her, paying special due to
the pleasant contrast between her ample bosom and the narrow waist, the irons
which he found longer, thicker, and more visible than usual. At the same time,
she learned that Sir Stephen had in all probability consented to lend her to
him the following week, since he was thanking Sir Stephen for something. At
which point Sir Stephen, taking her by the nape of the neck, gently told her to
wake up and, with Natalie, to go upstairs and wait in her room. </P>
<P>Had she good reason to be so upset, and to be so annoyed at Natalie who,
elated at the prospect of seeing O opened by someone other than Sir Stephen,
was doing a kind of wild Indian dance around her and shouting: </P>
<P>&quot;Do you think he'll go into your mouth too, O?&quot; You should have
seen the way he was looking at your mouth! Oh, how lucky you are to be desired
like that! I'm sure that he'll whip you: he came back three times to those
marks where you can see you've been whipped. At least you won't be thinking
about Jacqueline then!&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;I'm not always thinking about Jacqueline, you silly fool,&quot; O
replied. </P>
<P>&quot;No! I'm not silly and I'm not a fool. I know very well you miss
her,&quot; the child said. </P>
<P>It was true, but not completely. What O missed was not, properly speaking,
Jacqueline, but the use of a girl's body, with no restrictions attached. If
Natalie had not been declared off-limits to her, she would have taken Natalie,
and the only reason she had not violated the restriction was her certainty that
Natalie would be given to her at Roissy in a few weeks' time, and that, some
time previously, Natalie would be handed over in her presence by her, and
thanks to her. She was burning to demolish the wall of air, of space, of - to
use the correct term - void between Natalie and her, and yet at the same time
she was enjoying the wait imposed upon her. She said so to Natalie, who only
shook her head and refused to believe her. </P>
<P>&quot;If Jacqueline were her, and were willing,&quot; she said, &quot;you'd
caress her.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Of course I would,&quot; O said with a laugh. </P>
<P>&quot;There, you see,&quot; the child broke in. </P>
<P>How could she make her understand - and was it even worth the effort? - that
it wasn't so much that she was in love with Jacqueline, nor for that matter
with Natalie or any other girl in particular, but that she was only in love
with girls as such, girls in general - the way one can be in love with one's
own image - but in her case she always thought the other girls were more lovely
and desirable than she found herself to be. The pleasure she derived from
seeing a girl pant beneath her caresses, seeing her eyes close and the tips of
her breasts stiffen beneath her lips and teeth, the pleasure she got from
exploring her fore and aft with her hand - and from feeling her tighten around
her fingers, then sigh and moan - was more than she could bear; and if this
pleasure was so intense, it was only because it made her constantly aware of
the pleasure which she in turn gave when she tightened around whoever was
holding her, whenever she sighed or moaned, with this difference, that she
could not conceive of being given thus to a girl, the way this girl was given
to her, but only to a man. Moreover, it seemed to her that the girls she
caressed belonged by right to the man to whom she belonged, and that she was
only present by proxy. Had Sir Stephen come into her room during one of those
previous afternoons when Jacqueline had been wont to nap with her, and found O
caressing her, she would have spread her charge's thighs and held them apart
with both hands, without the slightest remorse, and in fact with the greatest
of pleasure, if had pleased Sir Stephen to possess her, rather than peering at
her through the trellised wall as he had one. She was apt at hunting, a
naturally trained bird of prey who would beat the game and always bring it back
to the hunter. And speaking of the devil... </P>
<P>It was at this point, just as she was thinking again with beating heart of
Jacqueline's lips, so pink and dainty beneath her downy fir, of the even more
delicate and pinker ring between her buttocks, which she had only dared force
on three occasions, that she heard Sir Stephen moving about in his room. She
knew that he could see her, although she could not see him, and once again she
felt that she was fortunate indeed to be constantly exposed this way,
constantly imprisoned by these all-encompassing eyes. Young Natalie was seated
on the white rug in the middle of the room, like a fly in a bowl of milk; while
O, standing in front of the massive bureau which also served as her dressing
table, and able to see herself from head to waist in a slightly greenish
antique mirror which was streaked like wrinkles in a pond, looked for all the
world like one of those late nineteenth-century prints in which the women are
wandering naked through their chambers in a subdued light, even though it is
mid-summer. </P>
<P>When Sir Stephen pushed open the door, she turned around so abruptly that
one of the irons between her legs struck one of the bronze knobs of the bureau
upon which she was leaning, and jingled. </P>
<P>&quot;Natalie,&quot; Sir Stephen said, &quot;run downstairs and get the
white cardboard box in the front living room.&quot; </P>
<P>When Natalie came back, she set the box down on the bed, opened it, and one
by one removed the objects inside, unwrapping the paper in which they were
packed, and handing them to Sir Stephen. They were masks, a combination
headpiece and mask; it was obvious they had been made to cover the entire head,
with the exception of the mouth and chin - and of course the slits for eyes.
Sparrow-hawk, falcon, owl, fox, lion, bull: nothing but animal masks, but
scaled to the size of the human head, made of real fur and feathers, the eye
crowned with lashes when the actual animal had lashes (as the lion), and with
the pelts or feathers descending to the shoulders of the person wearing them.
To make the mask fit snugly along the upper lips (there was an orifice for each
nostril) and along both cheeks, all one had to do was adjust a fairly loose
strap concealed inside this cope-like affair which hung down the back. A frame
made of molded, hardened cardboard located between the outside facing and the
inner lining of skin, kept the shape of the mask rigid. In front of the
full-length mirror, O tried on each of the masks. The most striking, and the
one she thought transformed her most and was also most natural, was one of the
owl masks (there were two), no doubt because it was composed of tan and tawny
feathers whose color blended beautifully with her tan; the cope of feathers
almost completely concealed her shoulders, descending half way down her back
and, in front, to the nascent curve of her breasts. Sir Stephen had her rub the
lipstick from her lips, then said to her as she took off the mask: </P>
<P>&quot;All right, you'll be an owl for the Commander. But O, and I hope you
forgive me, you'll be taken on a leash. Natalie, go look in the top drawer of
my desk, you'll find a chain and some pliers.&quot; </P>
<P>Natalie came back with the chain and pliers, which Sir Stephen used to force
open the last link, fastened it to the second ring that O was wearing in her
loins, then forced it closed again. The chain, similar to those used for dogs -
in fact that was what it was - was between four and five feet long, with a
leather strap on one end. After O had donned the mask, Sir Stephen told Natalie
to take the end of the chain and walk around the room, ahead of O. Three times
Natalie paraded around the room, trailing O behind her by the rings, O being
naked and masked. </P>
<P>&quot;Well, I must say,&quot; Sir Stephen remarked, &quot;the Commander was
right, all the hair will have to be removed. But that can wait till tomorrow.
Meanwhile, keep your chain on.&quot; </P>
<P>That evening, and for the first time in the company of Jacqueline and
Natalie, of Ren&eacute; and Sir Stephen, O dined naked, her chain pulled up
between her legs and across her buttocks and wrapped around her waist. Norah
was alone serving, and O avoided her gaze. Two hours before, Sir Stephen had
summoned her. </P>
<P>What shocked and upset the girl at the beauty parlor the following day, more
than the irons and the black and blue marks on her lower back, were the brand
new lacerations. O had gone there to have the offending hair removed, and it
did no good to explain to her that this wax-type depilatory, a method in which
the wax is applied and allowed to harden, then suddenly removed, taking the
hair with it - was no more painful than being struck with the riding crop. No
matter how many times she repeated it, or made an attempt to explain, if not
what her fate was, at least that she was happy, there was no way of reassuring
her or allaying her feeling of disgust and terror. The only visible result of
O's efforts to soothe her was that, instead of being looked upon with pity, as
she had been at first, she was beheld with horror. It made no difference how
kind and profuse were her thanks when she left the little alcove where she had
been spread-eagled as though for love, nor did it matter how generous a tip she
gave as she left, when it was all over, she had the feeling that she was being
evicted rather than leaving of her own free will. What did she care? It was
obvious to her that there was something shocking about the contrast between the
fur on her belly and the feathers on her mask, as it was obvious that this air
of an Egyptian statue, which this mask lent her, and which her broad shoulders,
narrow waist, and long legs only served to emphasize, to demand that her flesh
be perfectly smooth. Only the effigies of primitive goddesses portrayed so
proudly and openly the cleft of the belly between whose outer lips appeared the
more delicate line of the lower lips. And had any ever been seen sporting rings
in their nether lips? O recalled the plump red-haired girl at Anne-Marie's who
had said that all her master ever used the belly ring for was to attach her at
the foot of the bed, and she had also said that the reason he wanted her shaved
was because only in that way was she completely naked. O was worried about
displeasing Sir Stephen, who so enjoyed pulling her over to him by the fleece,
but she was mistaken: Sir Stephen found her more moving that way, and after she
had donned her mask, having removed all trace of lipstick above and below, the
upper and nether lips then being so uncommonly pale, that he caressed her
almost timidly, the way one does with an animal one wants to tame. </P>
<P>He had told her nothing about the place to which he was taking her, nor
indicated the time they would have to leave, nor had he said who the
Commander's guests would be. But he came and spent the rest of the afternoon
sleeping beside her, and in the evening had dinner brought up to the room, for
the two of them. </P>
<P>They left an hour before midnight, in the Buick, O swathed in a great brown
mountaineer's cape and wearing wooden clogs on her feet. Natalie, in a black
sweater and slacks, was holding her chain, the leather strap of which was
attached to the leather bracelet Natalie was wearing on her right wrist. Sir
Stephen was driving. The moon was almost full, and illuminated the road with
large snowlike spots, also illuminating the trees and houses of the villages
through which they passed, leaving everything else as black as India ink. Here
and there, groups of people were still clustered, even at this hour, on the
thresholds of streetside doors, and they could feel the people's curiosity
aroused the passage of that closed car (Sir Stephen had not lowered the top).
Some dogs were barking. On the side of the road bathed in moonlight, the olive
trees looked like the silver clouds floating six feet above the ground, and the
cypresses like black feathers. There was nothing real about this country, which
night had -turned into make-believe, nothing except the smell of sage and
lavender. The road continued to climb, but the same warm layer of air still lay
heavy over the earth. O slipped her cape down off her shoulders. She couldn't
be seen, there was not a soul left in sight. </P>
<P>Ten minutes later, having skirted a forest of green oak on the crest of a
hill, Sir Stephen slowed down before a long wall into which was cut a
porte-cochere, which opened at the approach of the car. He parked in some
forecourt as they were closing the gate behind him, then got out and helped
Natalie and O out, first having ordered O to leave her cape and clogs in the
car. </P>
<P>The door he pushed open revealed a cloister with Renaissance arcades on
three sides, the fourth side being an extension of the flagstone court of the
cloister proper. A dozen people were dancing on the terrace and in a courtyard,
a few women with very low-cut dresses and some men in white dinner jackets were
seated at small tables lighted by the candlelight; the record player was in the
left-hand gallery, and a buffet table had been set up in the gallery to the
right. </P>
<P>The moon provided as much light as the candles, though, and when it fell
upon O, who was being pulled forward by her black little shadow, Natalie, those
who noticed her stopped dancing, and the men got to their feet. The boy near
the record player, sensing that something was happening, turned around and,
taken completely aback, stopped the record. O had come to a halt; Sir Stephen,
motionless two steps behind her, was also waiting. </P>
<P>The Commander dispersed those who had gathered around O and had already
called for torches to examine her more closely. </P>
<P>&quot;Who is she,&quot; they were saying, &quot;who does she belong
to?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;You, if you like,&quot; he replied, and he led O and Natalie over to a
corner of the terrace where a stone bench covered with cushions was set against
a low wall. </P>
<P>When O was seated, her back against the wall, her hands lying on her knees,
with Natalie on the ground to the left of her feet, still holding onto the
chain, he turned around to them. O's eyes searched for Sir Stephen, and at
first could not find him. Then she sensed his presence, reclining on a chaise
lounge at the other corner of the terrace. He was able to see her, she was
reassured. The music had begun again, the dancers were dancing again. As they
danced, one or two couples moved over in her direction, as though by accident
at first, then one of the couples dropped the pretense and, with the woman
leading the way, marched boldly over. O stared at them with eyes that, beneath
her plumage, were darkened with bister, eyes opened wide like the eyes of the
nocturnal bird she was impersonating, and the illusion was so extraordinary
that no one thought of questioning her, which would have been the most natural
thing to do, as though she were a real owl, deaf to human language, and dumb. 
</P>
<P>From midnight to dawn, which began to lighten the eastern sky at about five,
as the moon waned and descended toward the west, people came up to her several
times and some even touched her, they formed a circle around her several times
and several times they parted her knees and lifted the chain, bringing with
them on of those two-branched candlesticks of Proven&ccedil;al earthenware -
and she could feel the flames from the candles warming the inside of her thighs
- to see how she was attached. </P>
<P>There was even one drunken American who, laughing, grabbed her, but when he
realized that he had seized a fistful of flesh and the chain which pierced her,
he suddenly sobered up, and O saw his face fill with the same expression of
horror and contempt that she had seen on the face of the girl who had given her
a depilatory; he turn and fled. </P>
<P>There was another girl, very young, a girl with bare shoulders and a choker
of pearls around her neck, wearing one of those white dresses young girls wear
to their first ball, two tea-scented roses at her waist and a pair of golden
slippers on her feet, and a boy made her sit down next to O, on her right. Then
he took her hand and made her caress O's breasts, which quivered to the touch
of the cool, light fingers, and touch her belly, and the chain, and the hole
through which it passed, the young girl silently, did as she was bid, and when
the boy said he planned to do the same thing to her, she did not seem shocked.
But even though they thus made use of O, and even though they used her in this
way as a model, or the subject of a demonstration, not once did anyone ever
speak to her directly. Was she then of stone or wax, or rather some creature
from another world, and did they think it pointless to speak to her? Or didn't
they dare? </P>
<P>It was only after daybreak, after all the dancers had left, that Sir Stephen
and the Commander, awakening Natalie who was asleep at O's feet, helped O to
her feet, led her to the middle of the courtyard, unfastened her chain and
removed her mask and, laying her back upon a table, possessed her one after the
other. </P>
